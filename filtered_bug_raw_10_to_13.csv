2002-01-28 16:36:44 EST,1936,Problem when overriding Dialog.createDialogArea (1GCQBAP),Problem when overriding Dialog.createDialogArea (1GCQBAP) [reply] Description Andre Weinand 2001-10-10 22:22:37 EDT If Dialog.createDialogArea(Composite parent) is overridden and a FComposite is returned nothing will be visible unless the correct layout data has been set on the Composite.  This is problematic since it couples a client's implementation of createDialogArea to an implementation detail of the base class (and it shows thatControl.setLayoutData is not a good idea in the first place).  If this  behavior cannot be fixed it should be documented in the method's JavaDoc!

They just call getString(String) then try to convert. This method can return null, though.  [reply] Comment 1 Nick Edgar 2001-10-22 12:46:47 EDT The current implementation seems to work, since new Boolean(null) and new Integer(null) yield the behaviour spec'ed for the DialogSettings convenience methods.  Need to check that this is spec'ed behaviour for how Boolean(String) and Integer(String) handle null.  [reply] Comment 2 Nick Edgar 2002-01-27 21:57:16 EST Please check to ensure we're conforming to spec. Explicit null checks would be better.  [reply] Comment 3 Ian Petersen 2002-01-31 12:03:40 EST I added the explicit null checks and now getDouble, getFloat, getInt and getLong all throw NumberFormatExceptions if the key that is passed in does not correlate to a setting.

2002-02-12 10:36:40 EST,5667,TVT: Reset Defaults button on resources Properties is misleading,"TVT: Reset Defaults button on resources Properties is misleading [reply] Description Dan Kehn 2001-11-08 11:48:03 EST From our TVT testers, a very minor nit:  If you open a doc, the default setting is with the ""Read only"" option unselected. If you set it, and click on Apply, if you then click on Reset Defaults, it doesn't reset the check-box as unselected.  This may be a ""generic"" button, but in this context, the button should either be removed or changed to ""Reset"" (which is defined as resetting those settings to their value before the panel was entered, not the same as Undo).  The button ""Reset Defaults"" doesn't make a lot of sense in this context.  I suppose you could define the default read-only state as ""off"", then selecting the button would systematically reset the read-only bit...  [reply] Comment 1 Ian Petersen 2002-02-12 10:36:40 EST Windows and Linux both set a new file's read-only bit to 'off', so this feels like a default.  The reset defaults button now sets the read-only bit to off to match this feeling.

Would it be possible, if eclipse can start up even when product.ini is not found? I would not mind having a default icon or default splash screen etc.  [reply] Comment 1 Ian Petersen 2002-01-28 15:23:19 EST I changed ProductInfo.java, PlatformInfo.java, and ConfigurationInfo.java to allow Eclipse to boot with missing or malformed product.ini, platform.ini, product.properties, or platform.properties.  Instead of throwing a CoreException, these prblems just get written to the log and Eclipse continues booting.  The worst case scenario now is that the workbench looks really ugly.

However, he should not have to copy the code in createButtonsForButtonBar just to be able to retrieve them later.  We should consider adding a method to Dialog:  /** * Returns the button with the given id. * * @param id (** copy the spec from createButton **) * @return the button with the given id, or <code>null</code> if not found */ Button getButton(int id);  [reply] Comment 1 Ian Petersen 2002-01-29 11:32:10 EST We decided to add getOKButton() and getCancelButton() methods instead of getButton(int id).  Now, the default implementation of Dialog.createButton stores buttons that are created with ids equal to IDialogConstants.OK_ID and IDialogConstants.CANCEL_ID in private fields and exposes them via the new methods.

2002-01-28 16:09:59 EST,7557,Properties page unresponsive after reopening,"Properties page unresponsive after reopening [reply] Description Paul Church 2002-01-14 13:34:23 EST Build: 20020109  After making the Properties view a fast view and then closing it, the view does not respond to mouse clicks when reopened. View remains unresponsive until Eclipse is restarted. Tested in both Java and Resource perspectives.  1. Launch a fresh Eclipse session. 2. Open a Properties view through Perspective->Show View->Properties, restore the view if it appears as a fast view. 3. Drag the view to the shortcut bar to make it a fast view. 4. Click the icon in the shortcut bar to pop up the properties view. 5. Close the view. 6. Re-open the Properties view through Perspective->Show View->Properties 7. The view appears as a regular view, but does not respond to mouse movement or clicks. All other views work normally. If Eclipse is closed and restarted the Properties view shows up in the same location and now works normally.  [reply] Comment 1 Nick Edgar 2002-01-15 14:54:50 EST I was unable to reproduce this on 20020109 plus the latest UI changes (20020115). Randy, was there a recent change here which would have fixed this? If not, please mark the PR as invalid.  [reply] Comment 2 Nick Edgar 2002-01-15 14:57:56 EST I was in the Resource perspective. Paul, when you say it was unresponsive, what exactly do you mean? That you couldn't drag the view, or that properties weren't properly shown and navigated? Since the workspace is empty, there are no properties shown.  But when I create a project, they work fine.  [reply] Comment 3 Nick Edgar 2002-01-15 15:09:04 EST See also bug 7536. Not clear that this is a duplicate though.  [reply] Comment 4 Paul Church 2002-01-15 15:28:52 EST The view was drawn correctly (including the correct contents for whatever was selected) but the buttons didn't 'highlight' on mouseover, buttons didn't 'press' (visually) when clicked, contents didn't highlight when clicked (keyboard navigation also wasn't possible), and no events happened when buttons were clicked. Trying to drag by the title bar produced no change in the view's appearance.  The contents of the 'frozen' properties view acutally do update when the active selection changes, and closing the perspective makes the view go away. It just appears that the view doesn't react to any mouse or keyboard events.  [reply] Comment 5 Simon Arsenault 2002-01-15 15:59:13 EST I've seem this problem happen also with the 20020109 build. If you look at the view when it is not responsive, it has all the fast view icons on it. It seems to think it is a fast view still. Come see me if you want to see how to reproduce it.  [reply] Comment 6 Ian Petersen 2002-01-28 16:09:59 EST This problem was in the Perspective class.  Clicking on the X to close a view eventually makes a call to Perspective.hideView(IViewPart) which, if the IViewPart is a fast view, calls Perspective.hideFastView(IViewPart). hideFastView is also called when you minimize a fast view so the view's control is disabled to prevent the focus from ending up on an invisible widget.  The problem was that showing the view again didn't necessesarily re-enable the control, so the view remained unresponsive.  I changed Perspective.hideView(IViewPart) to re-enable the IViewPart's control after the call to hideFastView returns.  While fixing this bug, I also discovered that a view might end up in an inconsistent state where it has the toolbar buttons of a fast view, but isn't one, or where it is a fast view, but doesn't have the pin or minimize buttons.  The fix was to change ViewPane.SystemContribution.fill(ToolBar, int).  This method gets called every time the view's toolbar manager needs to be updated, and it is responsible for deciding whether or not to include the pin and minimize buttons.  To make this decision, it was calling ViewPane.isFastView which then calls Perspective.isFastView. This return value may not reflect current pane state. Now, the decision is based on the internal instance variable fast.  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",Ian_Petersen@oti.com

2002-02-25 12:26:35 EST,8525,Dialog page resizing,"Dialog page resizing [reply] Description Alex Nan 2002-01-25 19:28:22 EST I encountered the following problem which I think might be common to other people: I have a wizard page (dialog page) that displays fine in english but for NL platforms (ex. German, French, Italian) the description of the page doesn't fit anymore, it allows only 2 lines of  text, so the page has to be resized somehow according to the length of the description. I write you the strings used in the description, maybe they might guide you somehow: ""No database or schema selected. Select a database or schema and try again."", ""Es wurde keine Datenbank bzw. kein Schema ausgew?hlt. W?hlen Sie eine Datenbank oder ein Schema aus, und wiederholen Sie die Anforderung."", ""Aucune sch?ma ou base de donn?es s?lectionn?. S?lectionnez une base de donn?es ou un sch?ma et tentez ´ nouveau l'op?ration."", sorry for the special chars that are corrupted... This is the code we are using to generate the content of the client area:  public void createControl(Composite parent) {  // top level group Composite composite = new Composite(parent,SWT.NONE); composite.setLayout(new GridLayout()); composite.setLayoutData(new GridData( GridData.VERTICAL_ALIGN_FILL | GridData.HORIZONTAL_ALIGN_FILL));  fbg = new FolderBrowseGroup(composite, this, """"); fbg.getFolderNameField().addListener(SWT.Modify, this);  createDatabaseSchemaGroup(composite);  setPageComplete(determinePageCompletion()); setControl(composite); // should be on top level composite/group }  private void createDatabaseSchemaGroup(Composite parent) { Composite dbSchGroup = new Composite(parent,SWT.NONE); GridLayout layout = new GridLayout(); layout.numColumns = 3; dbSchGroup.setLayout(layout); dbSchGroup.setLayoutData(new GridData(GridData.FILL_HORIZONTAL));  // database/schema selection new Label(dbSchGroup,SWT.NONE).setText(""Target"")); targetField = new Text(dbSchGroup, SWT.BORDER); GridData data = new GridData(GridData.FILL_HORIZONTAL); targetField.setLayoutData(data); targetField.setEditable(false);  targetBrowseButton = new Button(dbSchGroup, SWT.PUSH); targetBrowseButton.setText(RSCPlugin.getString(""Browse..."")); targetBrowseButton.addListener(SWT.Selection, this);  }  Actually the problem can be reproduced in a very simple scenario, create a wizard page that has, let's say, only a text box in the client area and set the description to a string sufficiently long. The wizard will resize according to the text boxes layout but it won't take into account the size of the description string, if this is long enough it will need more than 2 lines which are allocated for it. The user of the WizardPage class can control only the size of the client area, but he cannot figure out how much space the description will take because he doesn't have access to the font that is used to display the description etc. so it's really a matter of guessing. Thank you.  Alexandru Nan  [reply] Comment 1 Ian Petersen 2002-02-25 12:26:35 EST Rather than link the dialog's size to the length of its label, I've changed the setMessage and setErrorMessage methods on TitleAreaDialog to set the tooltip text equal to the text for the label.  This should allow the user to see the full text of the message by hovering over the label with the mouse, even if the label itself clips the text.  This change didn't make it into the latest stable build (20020214) but it should be in the next integration build.  [reply] Comment 2 Alex Nan 2004-11-09 19:07:46 EST Closing.

I changed the sources to put all the sources in a package called 'demo' instead of the default package. Then I put the jar file in my project area and refreshed it in Eclipse. Once I did this, I (obviously) had to change the actual source files that refer to any classes from the jar to include the package declaration. After doing this, I thought that everything should be fine and dandy - but, there still appears a ""problem indication"" marker wherever the new pcakge or its classes are used. The marker is not the fully filled red rectangle, but the white rectangle with the red border. If I turn on the ""show problems before compilation"" in the preferences, these same lines are also underlined with red wavy lines. Is this a bug in Eclipse?

Can you please describe a little more the nature of your problem ?   [reply] Comment 2 Vijay Aravamudhan 2002-09-30 17:00:47 EDT Well, according to the bug report, Sun has ""fixed"" the specs and the javac compiler to error out when any class files are not in a namespace (package). In other words, if anyone tries to compile their demo sources (which are not in any package), the compile would error out.  So I had to change some files to be in some dummy package - and when this was done, no errors/warnings showed up in the ""Tasks"" area - but there were still white boxes with red borders which showed up in the right margin area (which is used to normally indicate that there are compile warnings/errors).  [reply] Comment 3 Philipe Mulet 2002-10-02 06:45:32 EDT Got it. Now this change in javac is only part of JDK1.4. In a consistent manner, you will notice that when toggling our compiler in 1.4 mode, you'll get the same behavior (see Window>Preferences>Java>Compiler>JDK Compliance>Compiler Compliance Level>1.4).

This should work when the user is deleting one of the match- characters while the other one is right next to it (ie without any other characters in between them) 2) (Same as #1 for the parenthesis character) 3) Lets say I have a line which reads: MyObj instance = new MyObj(); Now I want to use a different constructor, one which accepts an argument. So I type: MyObj instance = new MyObj(SingletonFactory.getInstance<cursorPosition>); And the next character that I type is '('. Now I would think that the editor would be intelligent enough to add a second closing parenthesis (since it automatically adds a closing paren when I type in an opening one) - but it doesn't do this and thinks that since there is already a closing paren, it must be for the current object being typed in.  The auto-complete feature for inserting the above 2 characters is great - but please fix them. Also, could this feature be extended to add in '{' (curly braces) too - along with the corresponding closing brace?

Now I am seeing this error after the first close-paren. If you look at the screen shot that I am attaching, the cursor is between the first close paren and the next one. So the ""context"" is still within a paren enclosure, with the valid paren character existing right after the cursor position. So at this point, if I type in a ')', it should just be consumed and the cursor position should move to the right of this character.

In it, base and target are identical. The generated merge result is correct according to our algorithm.  The text around the test indicates that it's intended to be the same as file1 in script test 1. But in script test 1, base and target are *different*.  I tried adding the following as a new test, which is the same as file1 in script test 1, and it worked correctly. :test3a # The same as the first test script in org.stellation.misc\tests\test1\file1 # Base sequence   Delta Sequence   Target Sequence   Expected Sequence abc             abc              abc               abc def		  def              bingo             bingo ghi             123456           def               def jkl             ghi              ghi               123456 mno             jkl              jkl               ghi pqr             mno              mno               jkl stu             pqr              pqr               mno vwx             vwx              stu               pqr yz		  yz               vwx               vwx ""  ""		  ""  ""             yz                yz """"		  ''		   ""  ""		      ""  ""   [reply] Comment 8 Mark C.

[reply] Comment 9 Jonathan Gossage 2002-10-22 17:07:33 EDT I was afraid that might be the case for test 3 since I had a lot of trouble with the test data and CVS. I am glad to here that there is only one problem.  [reply] Comment 10 Mark C. Chu-Carroll 2002-10-25 20:26:14 EDT The glitch was an off-by-one error causing errors when there was a trailing addition in delta or target that was one line long.  I'd like to get someone to add more test cases to make sure that all of the one-line cases are correct - I want to make sure that there are no more off-by-ones like this. (Jonathan, I'm tentatively transferring this to you. If you don't want to do work out some more test cases, just transfer it back to me.)  The change won't get checked in for a day or two, until I'm sure that the ACL changes in my workspace won't break anything.

In my project, there are certain properties files that are in the lib directory. So if I select one of these, I get an error message saying that only jar/zip files should be selected. But shouldnt any files which dont have the extension of either '.jar' or '.zip' be automatically filtered out from the tree view?

But even with that the user must generate and install keypairs, which  * is non-trivial. E.g. start @  http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1#keygen  and skip the SF-specific content.  * requires external tools (i.e. Cygwin ssh-keygen)  Thus cvsssh2 represents only a partial solution to the ssh2 problem. I would like to see a more complete one, wherein one or more Eclipse plugins assists the user with  1 keypair generation. Note that JSch (the cvsssh2 folks) may already have work in this direction:  http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/index.html > TODO  > * generating RSA, DSA key pairs.  2 keypair installation. Given the keypairs, local install (creating something that works like a ~/.ssh) is pretty trivial: save to local dir, and point to it. (See Windows>Preferences>Team>CVS>CVSSSH2.) Remote install is trickier, but Jsch appears to already support scp and sftp, and you already have org.eclipse.team.ftp, so again existing work could be leveraged.  With this functionality, Eclipse would ease another barrier to entry to participation in OSS and IIOSB projects. I also realize you already have things to do, but it also seems that, in this case, existing pieces need only to be ""glued together.""

2004-04-29 04:45:17 EDT,59557,Optimized Heap Dump directory specification in piAgent,"Optimized Heap Dump directory specification in piAgent [reply] Description Allan Pratt 2004-04-21 19:10:11 EDT This bug reflects decisions by me, Anandi, and Richard. It is targeted at Piyush.  We decided:  1. There should be just one way to set the directory name that opt heap dumps will be written into.  2. That way should be in a <variable> element in ServiceConfig.xml, not an <option> in the agent's pluginconfig.xml. This way it's visible to all agents, not just the piAgent.  3. The variable name should not be TEMP, it should be LOCAL_AGENT_TEMP_DIR.  4. The default value for LOCAL_AGENT_TEMP_DIR, written into serviceconfig.xml by SetConfig, should be %TMP%  Here are the OptHeapDump-related action items that come out of those agreements:  * Please change the Leakbot code in the agent so it uses ra_getEnvironmentVariable(""LOCAL_AGENT_TEMP_DIR"") (and not an option query for OPTHEAP_TEMP_DIR) to find out where to write optheap dump files.  * If LOCAL_AGENT_TEMP_DIR is not set, please use ra_getEnvironmentVariable (""TMP"") as a backup. It should always be set, on all platforms. But if it's not set, give it whatever fallback behavior it has now, write to the current directory or something.

Drop a jButton, or any other swing component, on to the content pane. And go to 'icon' in the properties and select the entry helper button. This should launch the Select an Image File dialog. In the filters option you can filter by *.jpg, *.gif and *.pkg but not *.bmp? Also, shouldn't the user be allowed to input they're own filter like *.XYZ?  [reply] Comment 1 Jeff Myers 2004-05-24 10:08:45 EDT This is dependant on which file formats that are able to be read by Swing, which are only *.gif, *.jpg and *.png.

2004-07-12 22:47:50 EDT,64434,AS400 - RAC File Copy is not working,"AS400 - RAC File Copy is not working [reply] Description Anandi Krishnamurthy 2004-05-27 16:02:14 EDT Here is how I found out that this does not work. I logged into toras3rm. The rac version in /home/racbuild/head/trybuid has a couple of fixes needed to get to the stage where the RAC File Copy bug is exposed. Please use that if you can.  I brought up the workbench, connected to the RAC on toras3rm, and did Manual Leak Analysis on simpleleaker (which is in /home/testcup on that machine).  Once the application comes up, take 2 heapdump by clicking on the camera icon that shows up, DETACH from the test program, terminate the test program.  Now, bring up the context menu on the profiling entry for the run and select ""Analyze for Leaks"". The first step that this does is to copy the files from the AS400 to your local workspace using RAC File Copy. This fails.  [reply] Comment 1 Anandi Krishnamurthy 2004-05-27 16:19:14 EDT You need the 2 leak analysis plugins to reproduce this bug. Please go to http://pplus-web-1.cupertino.ibm.com/bluerat_build/ and download the latest versions of the following 2 plugins:  com.ibm.rational.pd.leak.analysis com.ibm.rational.pd.leak.ui  [reply] Comment 2 Robert Danek 2004-06-04 18:51:11 EDT I'm not familiar with the File Copy code in the RAC, so my comments are based on best guesses as to how this stuff is supposed to work.  If you look at the servicelog.log when RAServer starts you will see  <SERVER_MSG time=""2004:6:4:18:10:1"" severity=""SEVERE"" text=""Could not get ID for method file server constructor"" file=""./framework/RAServer/RACommS.c"" line=""801""/>  That is, the file server isn't being started.  The problem is that when you make JNI calls, the strings you pass to JNI have to be in UTF-8. To do this, you can use  #ifdef __OS400__ #pragma convert(819) #endif  <code where string literals should be in ASCII>  #ifdef __OS400__ #pragma convert(0) #endif  I made some changes to RACommS.c to do this where appropriate in the createFileServer() method. You can see these changes in /home/racbuild/head/trybuild/collection/framework/RAServer/RACommS.c (the original copy of the file has a .original file extension). These changes seem to have gotten the file server running.  After this I found that someone was calling the method ra_destroyRASTRING() with a null pointer. This was crashing the RAC when I went to do the ""Analyze for leaks"" (i.e., when the file copy happened). This was a simple update to RACommon/RAComm.c to make sure the passed in value was not NULL. (Again, this is also updated on toras3rm). This was the quick fix... the method really shouldn't be called with a null pointer ... is the file server code doing this somewhere?  So after the above changes, I got to the point where when I do the ""Analyse for Leaks"" I actually see a nonzero file being copied to workspace\ProfileProject\leakanalysisheapdir on my local machine. So the file copy is now sort of working. I say sort of because the ""Analyse for Leaks"" operation now seems to hang on the workbench with the ""in progress"" graphic at the bottom right of the screen continuously going without ever finishing.  I would need someone else to take a look at this with me at this point to figure out what's going wrong.  [reply] Comment 3 Anandi Krishnamurthy 2004-06-04 19:24:50 EDT Robert, my changes to fix the optHeaps for AS400 have not been checked in. So the heap files that are getting generated are not correct. Which is one reason why leak analysis is failing for you.  If you look in the project directory in your workspace, you should see a subdirectory named leakanalysisheapdir. This is where we save the optHeap files. If the files are copied over to this directory and the sizes etc. match, then RAC File Copy is OK.  Sample workspace dir: D:\ews\runtime-workspace\ProfilingProject8  Also, I am planning to check in my AS400 changes over the weekend. I just got the go-ahead for that.

Detach the agent. Do Run->Profile... attach this time with profiling set that uses Opt Heap, e.g. Leak Detection Manual heap dumps. Start monitoring, and capture heapdump. java.exe crashes with The application accessed memory that could not be read.  [reply] Comment 1 Robert Danek 2004-05-28 15:49:02 EDT What driver/build are you using? There was a problem with ""detach"" that got into one of the M9 drivers that was fixed in a later driver (see bug 62138).  Also, I'm not familiar with using optHeap mode. Is there anything in addition to the regular Hyades build (on the UI side) that I need in order to choose the profiling set that uses ""Opt Heap - Leak Detection manual heap dumps""? I don't believe the regular Hyades install has these options.  [reply] Comment 2 Geary Ridings 2004-05-28 16:31:24 EDT You need the 2 leak analysis plugins to reproduce this bug. Please go to http://pplus-web-1.cupertino.ibm.com/bluerat_build/ and download the latest versions of the following 2 plugins:  com.ibm.rational.pd.leak.analysis com.ibm.rational.pd.leak.ui  The driver came from hyades.runtime_3.0_20040526_2302.zip in a recent nightly build.  [reply] Comment 3 Robert Danek 2004-05-28 16:40:44 EDT The bug is fixed in the build that you mentioned, but I'm still a bit concerned about the driver that you are running... when you say ""The driver came from hyades.runtime_3.0_20040526_2302.zip in a recent nightly build,"" the thing is, the piAgent.dll  does not ship with the hyades.runtime_3.0_*.zip file (nor does any of the other datacollection components). You need to also download hyadesdc.win_ia32.zip that is associated with the nightly build. To confirm, is this actually the case, or is it possible that you are picking up a different piAgent.dll that was already previously installed on your machine?  [reply] Comment 4 Robert Danek 2004-05-31 10:30:01 EDT I tried accessing  http://pplus-web-1.cupertino.ibm.com/bluerat_build/ as mentioned in comment #2 so that I could download the required plugins and try reproducing the problem. Unfortunately, I am not able to access pplus-web-1.cupertino.ibm.com. This site must be buried somewhere behind a firewall, since I can't even ping it. Could you make the required plugins available on another site? Thanks.  [reply] Comment 5 Robert Danek 2004-06-01 16:16:07 EDT I've reproduced the problem, and attached the visual C++ debugger to catch where the crash is originating.  The problem seems to be in StatelessHeapSnapshotManager_C.cpp (in the datacollection package under collectors/native/java_profiler.) In particular, it is in the following segment of code:   -------------------------start code snippet ------------ extern ""C"" int StatelessHeapSnapshotManager_handleHeapSnapshot_FromC(JNIEnv*      env, int          dump_level, char*        begin, char*        end) { /* Need to check if header has to be written */ /* or moves and frees file need to be closed */ int errorCode = 0 ; try { switch (_filler->mode() ) {         **** <----   _filler == NULL!! case Header : _filler->writeHeaderFile() ; break ; case MovesAndFrees : _filler->closeMovesAndFreesFile() ; break ; } -------------------------end code snippet ------------  The _filler variable is NULL, so when the heap dump is being done, the jvm crashes. Now, why is _filler == NULL?  I did some digging and it turns out that _filler is initialized in the method StatelessHeapSnapshotManager_setup_FromC() (also in the StatelessHeapSnapshotManager_C.cpp file). But this setup method is only called once from JVM_OnLoad() (in JvmpiWriter.c), and only if the trace mode is TraceOptimizedHeap. Since, in the given scenario, we do not launch in TraceOptimizedHeap mode, it turns out that the required setup method is never called. So when you reattach in the TraceOptimizedHeap mode, you crash.  The way StatelessHeapSnapshotManager is setup/initialized needs to be improved to take into account that people may detach and reattach at some later point in the TraceOptimizedHeap mode (even though they launched in a different, unrelated mode).  I'm going to await word from Tanuj on who I should reassign this bug to on the Cupertino team... .  [reply] Comment 6 Robert Danek 2004-06-01 16:22:38 EDT reassigning per above comment.

For example, _UI_VisibilityKind_package_literal, _UI_VisibilityKind_private_literal, _UI_VisibilityKind_protected_literal, _UI_VisibilityKind_public_literal were not translated to German (plugin_de.properties).  [reply] Comment 1 Cam-Thu Le 2004-11-01 11:29:26 EST Except for Brazil, none of these keys are translated for the remanining group 1 languages. This is mostly the countries'decision. As this is a tool product built on java, some countries decided to leave the terms ""private"", ""public"",""package"" and ""protected"" in English. For consistency purpose, do you want to keep the Brazilian translation for these terms as is or have them reverted to English ? I do not think the other countries would want to translate these keys.  [reply] Comment 2 Kenn Hussey 2004-11-01 12:03:02 EST Support for localization of enumeration literals wasn't provided by EMF until late in the 2.0.0 release. I was under the impression that these translations were not done because of this. It seems odd to me that these countries would translate nearly everything (features, types, messages) except for enumeration literals... At the very least it might make sense to follow up with them in the next release to confirm that they indeed do not want these strings translated.  [reply] Comment 3 Cam-Thu Le 2004-11-01 12:18:16 EST I do not think so. The files were provided to the translators during TVT. That would explain why Brazil translated these keys. If these keys were added when we already exited TVT, the keys will not be present in the translated file. Will remind the translators that these keys can be translated in our next release, but the translation choice is theirs.

2004-11-01 05:48:50 EST,77354,Add support to GLA for no situationType abstract  class rules in adapter,"Add support to GLA for no situationType abstract  class rules in adapter [reply] Description Dave Smith 2004-11-01 02:59:28 EST The GLA editor no longer creates a rule for situationType abstract CBE element.   Therefore, the CBEFormatter GLA class needs to be changed to support adapter files with and without this element in the IDirectedGraph paths.  Also, when a situationType rule exists in the adapter file, the user can use the childChoice attribute to prune the situation type parsing rules.  When the situationType element doesn't exist, childChoice can't be specified on the situation element because the required categoryName element must be present, as well as a particular situation type element.  But the categoryName value must match the particular situation type, so this value can be generated by the CBEFormatter when a situation type rule is processed.  Therefore, if CBEFormatter is changed to set the categoryName automatically, rules for categoryName are not required and the user can set the childChoice attribute on the situation element.

2005-08-04 16:34:12 EDT,90344,Building JSR 175 annotation into binding and exposing them through DOM,"Building JSR 175 annotation into binding and exposing them through DOM [reply] Description Theodora Yeung 2005-04-05 14:54:42 EDT The following is an outline for injecting annotation information into the type system bindings and making it available to DOM API users. Please comment and forward to a wider audience as necessary.  1)org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.IBinaryAnnotation objects will be created when the class file is first read. Just like the IBinaryType and IBinaryField objects inside the jdt compiler.  2)org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.IBinaryAnnotation will be turned into an org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.Annotation at the same time when a IBinaryType is turned into a BinaryTypeBinding which occur during LookupEnvironment.createBinaryTypeFrom(IBinaryType, ...).  3)Also proposing a new class named ""AnnotationBuilder"", which has a similar role to the ""BindingResolver"" as both are responsible for turning the internal presentation of type system objects into the DOM version for public consumption.  This propsed approached is very similar to how binary types are injected into the system.  /* * New API added to * <code>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.IBinaryType</code>, * <code>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.IBinaryMethod</code> * <code>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.IBinaryField</code> */ public IBinaryAnnotation[] getAnnotations();

}  [reply] Comment 1 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-13 23:23:50 EDT Created attachment 19892 [details] Containing patches for this bug  After unzipping the file, there are two directories, ""ALL"" and ""API"".  The directory named ""ALL"" has the diff for everything that I have done. The files in there directory matches the directories under ""org.eclipse.jdt.core"" in CVS.  The directory named ""API"" only has diff for new API. The subdirectory named ""dom"" has API diff for the dom component and the one named ""compiler"" has API diff for the compiler component. The individual files in there are diffs for individual java files matched by name. e.g compiler/MethodBinding.txt contains the diff for org.eclipse/jdt/internal/compiler/lookup/MethodBinding.java  Please review.  I am still in the process of testing the new code and most likely will not pass all the required tests. The purpose of this patch is simply to get some feedback on the API as well as the implementation approach.  [reply] Comment 2 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-13 23:29:14 EDT Created attachment 19893 [details] First patch for this bug (in another setup)  I have added another attachment which is contains the patch itself for everything I have done in org.eclipse.jdt.core. Unlike the previous attachment, it is not a zip.  This patch may include diff/patches for bug 87718 from Mike Kauffman. (We work off the same code base, outside CVS, and it is hard to generate a patch just for the work I have done.)  [reply] Comment 3 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-14 13:24:47 EDT The patches attached passed all the jdt.core tests.  [reply] Comment 4 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-14 17:20:55 EDT Created attachment 19925 [details] Patch for the APT branch that passes all jdt.core tests  A new patch that compiles correctly under 1.4 that passes all the jdt.core tests. This patch is for APT branch of org.eclip.jdt.core.  [reply] Comment 5 Jim des Rivieres 2005-04-15 01:34:26 EDT Created attachment 19927 [details] patch to o.e.jdt.core/dom (APT branch) with improvements  Theodora, I've reviewed the DOM API portion of the patch. I believe the proposed API additions will give client the access they need to annotation. I have some suggested renamings and some small improvements.  public interface IResolvedAnnotation ITypeBinding getAnnotationType(); IResolvedMemberValuePair[] getDeclaredMemberValuePairs(); IResolvedMemberValuePair[] getAllMemberValuePairs(); - rename from IAnnotationInstance to suggest it is resolved info like bindings  - add getAllMemberValuePairs to return implicit defaulted pairs as well; the full list is what many clients will want  public interface IResolvedMemberValuePair public String getName(); public IMethodBinding getMemberBinding(); public Object getValue(); - rename from IElementValuePair to suggest it is resolved info like bindings - rename getElementValue -> getValue for consistency with MemberValuePair.getValue - rename getMethodBinding -> getMemberBinding - delete getElementType; unnecessary; client can do getMemberBinding().getResultType()  Annotation public IResolvedAnnotation resolveAnnotation(); CompilationUnit public ASTNode findDeclaringNode(IResolvedAnnotation resolvedAnnotation) { - fine as proposed  IBinding public IResolvedAnnotation[] getAnnotations(); - pull method up from ITypeBinding, IVariableBinding, IMethodBinding so that package annotations are exposed as well - change spec to return empty list rather than null, to make it more convenient for clients  IMethodBinding public IResolvedAnnotation[] getParameterAnnotations(int paramIndex); public boolean isAnnotationMember(); public Object getDefaultValue(); - rename isAnnotationMethod -> isAnnotationMember for greater consistency ( the node type is named AnnotationTypeMember)  The patch is for the o.e.jdt.core/dom subtree only (APT branch) and has fleshed out specs for everything.  Some of the other things I noticed - all new API needs to be tagged with @since so that we have a record when the API entered the platform. I didn't know what Philippe and you have discussed, so I marked all the new classes and method @since 3.2 on the assumption that they will appear only on 3.2. - since there is new API involved, the test suites will need to be upgraded as well to include tests for the new API elements - the implementation classes AnnotationInstance and ElementValuePair are public; since I doubt you intended these to be exposed as API, then should to be package-private - it would help if the code formatting followed the same conventions used elsewhere in JDT Core  [reply] Comment 6 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-15 16:10:33 EDT Thanks for the feedback. Will adjust the API and implementation as suggested.  The one question I have is what exactly should the behavior be for IPackageBinding.getAnnotations(). Unlike types, fields or methods, there may be mutiple places that declared a package. I noticed that the jdt supports the recommended way of declaring package annotation which is through package- info.java. Does this mean that IPackageBinding.getAnnotations() should only return annotations declared at the package declaration inside package- info.java? So, if in some source file where there are package annotations, these annotatons should be ignored from the perspective of IPackageBinding.getAnnotations()?  I don't think the information from package-info.java is being utilized. org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.PackageBinding.getAnnotationTagBits() is always returning 0 as it didn't override the implementation at Binding. Is that correct? The reason I asked is that I am wondering how to get this piece of information back into the system.  Thanks.  Theodora Yeung   [reply] Comment 7 Jim des Rivieres 2005-04-15 17:12:22 EDT The discussion section in JLS3 7.4.1.1 strongly recommends that the package declaration inside package-info.java be consider the only legitimate place to annotate a package declaration. So IPackageBinding.getAnnotations() should return those annotations.  Frederic, perhaps you could take a look at the what's happing to the package annotations in the compiler.  [reply] Comment 8 Philipe Mulet 2005-04-16 02:52:44 EDT The compiler never needs the annotation info for package anywhere; only use could be to feed some downstream tools appropriately.  [reply] Comment 9 Jim des Rivieres 2005-04-16 20:23:25 EDT A tool would expect to be able to access package annotations if there are any. How difficult would it be to retain the information when the package-info.java is compiled?  [reply] Comment 10 Theodora Yeung 2005-04-18 22:20:04 EDT I believe today, when package-info.java gets compiled, package-info.class gets generated. The annotation information is held by the by the synthetic type ""package-info"". The problem I have tody is not knowing how to retrieve this information back out from inside the compiler. I think if ""package-info"" is in binary form the problem can easily be solved. I Could simply go look for the type name ""package-info"" with the proper package name. However, if package-info.java exists, i.e. the package info is in source, then this approach would fail. The NameEnvironment would find the file and be able to create the proper compilation unit. However, the type does not actually exist in source, and the search fail. It seems like I am going around this problem the wrong way. Is there anyway to look for a file and parse it from the LookupEnvironment?  [reply] Comment 11 Philipe Mulet 2005-04-19 04:03:29 EDT We could imagine having the DOM AST binding support be able to read package-info.class in order to look for annotations. This might be confusing in the presence of package-info.java as well. Note that in the latter case, one can use the DOM AST to find out about source annotations.  [reply] Comment 12 Theodora Yeung 2005-05-18 20:37:50 EDT Proposeadding IResolvedMemberValuePair.isDefault(). This will be particularly useful when client iterate over the array of member value pairs that they obtain from IResolvedAnnotation.getAllMemberValuePairs()  [reply] Comment 13 Jim des Rivieres 2005-05-19 08:31:25 EDT Adding IResolvedMemberValuePair.isDefault() would make good sense.

Here are the details:  Select a genmodel, right click and select Reload... Select EMF ecore model Click Next Nothing happens Click Next Error dialog appears saying that you need to select an ecore model Dismiss the error dialog The Model URI field will be empty - it used to contain the paths to the ecore files that were previously loaded The Generator model file name field will be empty - it should default to the selected genmodel  If you fill in the Model URI, and the genmodel name, you can get to the next page Select the packages, add the referenced generator models and select the appropriate referenced packages Click Finish You get a NPE   If you are able to reproduce this, any chance you could spin another integration build with the fix?  [reply] Comment 1 Ed Merks 2005-06-10 07:09:33 EDT Bryan,  No I can't reproduce this (in my develop environment nor in a fresh install of RC1 and the latest EMF driver). It sounds to me like you have a bad installation. Have you tried running with -clean.  Note that we moved to using manifests in this build, and some folks are seeing strange access errors and failures to load classes when they update an existing installation.  If your problem persists with clean installation, please show the stack traces in the .log and reopen the bugzilla.  We likely also need the sample files you are reloading as well, i.e., the .genmodel and .ecore...  [reply] Comment 2 Ed Merks 2005-06-10 13:46:56 EDT Bryan,  I encountered this problem:  !STACK 0 org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList$BasicIndexOutOfBoundsException: index=1, size=1 at java.lang.Throwable.<init>(Throwable.java) at org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList$BasicIndexOutOfBoundsException.<init>(BasicEList.java:494) at org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList.get(BasicEList.java) at org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.genmodel.impl.GenOperationImpl.initialize(GenOperationImpl.java:585)  which reveals a long standing but in GenOperationImpl.initialize.  It's very easy to fix.  I'll reopen this bugzilla to fix it, I'll attach the .class file so that you can patch your driver, and I'll downgrade the severity since you'll have a workaround.  You also seem to have a broken Ecore reference from prog/Program/execute/executionHarness to its type.

Please correct me if this is so.   Procedure:  1. Create a new Flexible Java project (New->Project->Flexible Java Project) 1a. In the Flexible Project wizard, set the Name = ""TestEJB"" 1b. Click on the Show Advanced button (assuming that Geronimo is not the default server) 1c. Select Geronimo V1.0 (Generic) as the Server 1d. Click on ""Finish""  2. Switch to the J2EE Perspective  3. For Project TestEJB, create an EJB Module (New->J2EE EJB Module) 3a. The name of the module will be ""TestEJBModule"" 3b. Leave all defaults (creation of client, annotation, etc) unchanged 3c. Click on ""Finish"" (We don't want to change anything else).  4. Create a new EJB (In the J2EE Perspective, EJB Projects/TestEJBModule, select New->Other->Enterprise Javabean).  PROBLEM 1: The Create Enterprise Javabean wizard only enables the selection of Session Beans and Message Beans. There is no selection for Entity Beans!  4a. Select Session Beans as the bean type. Click on ""Next"". 4b. The name of the package will be ""beans.ejb.test"". 4c. The name of the bean will be ""FacadeTestBean"" 4d. Leave ""Generate Annotation Support"" checked 4e. Click on ""Finish"", because we aren't changing anything else  5. Create a new Geronimo Server (Select the ""Server"" tab, right click on New->Server) 5a. Select ""Geronimo V1.0 Server"". Leave all else unchanged; click on ""Next"" 5b. In the next dialog, leave everything unchanged. Click on ""Next"" 5c. Add testEJBModule to the list of configured projects. Click on ""Finish""  6. Start the server (Right- click on Geronimo->Start with the Server tag selected)  7. Publish the EJB (Right- click on Geronimo->Publish)  PROBLEMS:  1. The deployment of the EJB fails, with the following exception thrown:  Server reports: Remote interface class not found: beans.ejb.test.FacadeTest org.apache.geronimo.deployment.DeploymentException:

The client code fails to compile. All references to javax.ejb are unresolved.  3. It appears that the necessary interfaces (Home, Remote) are mising from the EJB module.  4. Furthermore, there appears to be no way to generate the necessary stub code (right- clicking on the various projects and files only invokes a validator, nothing else).  Apparently there are many things missing in the handling of EJBs with this tool. For this reason, the Geronimo and other plugins are unusable for EJB development.  [reply] Comment 1 Tim Francis 2005-06-21 10:35:10 EDT Support for Geronimo EJBs within WTP, while very reasonable, is not available yet.

2005-08-02 17:13:00 EDT,100998,APT reconcile loop,"APT reconcile loop [reply] Description Gary Horen 2005-06-20 21:29:50 EDT Repro: 1. Build APT branch (see org.eclipse.jdt.apt.core/howtobuildme.txt). 2. Into the built workspace, import attached demo.zip. This contains annotation processor for TypeGeneratingAnnotation. 3. Debug workspace into which attached demoUserProject.zip has been imported. 4. Open demo.Quack.java in user project. 5. Uncomment import and reference to GeneratedFileTest type. 6. Add and remove the @TypeGeneratingAnnotation to/from the class.  Manifestations: 1. When you add @TypeGeneratingAnnotation to the Quack class (and sometimes when you remove same), the workspace will build over and over again, and the generated type will appear and disappear from the project. 2. When you save the file, the looping behavior will stop, in either the annotation add or remove case. So apparently this only happens on the recomcile code path. 3. If you remove the references to the generated type (both the import and reference) the problem goes away.

Repro:  1.  Disable reconcile-path APT to dispatch 2.  Rebuild Petstore project. 3.  Note deadlock.  The beehive project .zip files are too large to upload to bugzilla, so please contact me (mkaufman@bea.com) with info on where to get them from.    Setup Instructions for Beehive Petstore Demo --------------------------------------------  1.  WTP-enable your eclipse installation.  You'll need to drop the following plugins into your eclipse\plugins directory.  6/17 I-build of WTP - http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/I-I20050617- 200506171814/wtp-I20050617.zip 6/9 build of EMF    - http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/emf-sdo-xsd-SDK- I200506091102.zip RC1 of GEF 3.1      - http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/GEF-SDK-3.1RC1.zip JME 1.1 M2          - http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drivers/JEM-SDK-1.1M2.zip  2.  Get the org.eclipse.beehive and org.eclipse.beehive.zip & org.eclipse.beehive.ide.eclipse.core.zip plugins from the file share, and exppand them onto your hard-drive 3.  Import these projects into your workspace that contains the apt projects 4.  Launch a debug instance of eclipse from this workspace. 5.  Get the J1Petstore.zip and JDBCControlSample.zip files from the file share, and extract them onto your filesystem. 6.  Import these projects into your debug workspace. 7.  Beehive-enable your projects, for J1Petstore and JDBCControlSample a) right-click the project, and then choose Add/Remove Beehive support b) open the .project file and make sure that the beehive builder has been removed c) right-click the project and then choose Add/Remove Beehive support again d) got to ""Project | Properties | Java Annotaiton Processing "", and then choose the ""apply"" button, and then choose the ""OK"" button. (this will cause the options to be persisted)  7.  Do a clean build of the J1Petstore project (note the many bugs and crappy performance) 8.  Do a clean build of the JDBCControlSample project (note the many bugs and crappy performance)  Note that the JDBCControlSample project is a smaller project, and builds more quickly than J1Petstore project.  Also note that there are some nasty bugs here.  You may need to disable the reconcile-time apt dispatch (see APTDispatch.java), and disable the resource & model listeners (see the GeneratedFileManager's init() method)  [reply] Comment 1 Mike Kaufman 2005-07-07 20:30:34 EDT  I think the fix here is to wrap up calls into GeneatedFileManager with an IWorkspaceRunnable class.  We should use the workspace-root as the ISchedulingRule, or possibly use a series of operations, one for each project.  At any rate, it would be good to stop synchronzing on the GeneratedFileManager instance, and start using the Eclipse resource locks.  APTDispatch during reconcile is TBD, since we've got scheduling problems around the lock taken by a save or saveAs operation (file or project-level lock), and the lock required by JavaModelOperations necessary to get a compilation unit (workspace-level lock).  [reply] Comment 2 Mike Kaufman 2005-07-12 16:45:32 EDT  Fixed this by making sure we weren't holding the GeneratedFileManager's lock when doing any operations that would take a different lock (e.g, java model operations or resource operations).

[reply] Comment 9 Andrew J Huff 2005-07-11 04:39:29 EDT I haven't looked too closely at it, but I think I can see what the bug is... you have a file called ""commons-logging-1.0.3.jar"" in your classpath... and the ""log to a file"" option in ajc is ""-log filename"" - I think it's seeing the -log in commons-logging..

Let us know if this works, since we don't have a test case in the suite, and Andrew can resolve the bug as fixed  (if not also reassign to compiler, since it wasn't an Ant task bug).

2006-02-16 15:20:05 EST,103198,Re-deploying Web modules  error,"Re-deploying Web modules  error [reply] Description Seng Phung Lu 2005-07-08 15:02:33 EDT Hi Tim, I think you were expecting a 'geronimo-jetty.xml' configuration file to be gen'd in the WEB-INF directory when we added the project/module to the server and ran it.  So this bug can address that.  With this fix, I hope to be able to access web apps on the server via a discoverable context root which should be in the geronimo-jetty.xml model.  The default behaviour is to use the web.xml web-app id(WebApp_ID by default) as the context root and I'd like to be able to either set it or get the context root from the Geronimo server.  My concern is that ""WebApp_ID"" is not unique when there may be multiple Web modules in multiple projects.  Hopefully, having the geronimo-jetty.xml config file will resolve this problem.  [reply] Comment 1 Nicholas Irving 2005-07-09 20:31:55 EDT Accoriding to the IBM tutorial on WTP and Geronimo, is says that this file should be generated, but I cannot see it anywhere. It obviously worked in M4 and the correct plugin, but broke in M5.  [reply] Comment 2 Seng Phung Lu 2005-07-11 11:03:51 EDT Hi Tim, I'm resettnig the severity to blocker b/c we need this fix in order to get further in adding support for Web services on Geronimo.  The runway is pretty short.  I believe Wed. July 13 is when WTP goes into must fix mode.  If the fix cannot be contained by then, we can probably lower the severity again and target it for the next milestone.

[reply] Comment 7 Seng Phung Lu 2005-07-13 17:39:50 EDT Hi Tim, Thanks for the patches. I am able to get further with them.  The problem now is that redeployment or deploying another module doesn't quite work 100%.  The behaviour I see is that although both modules are deployed, not all of the second module's files cannot be served.  Try this: 1) Create a project and index.html, and launch ""Run on Server"" 2) Create a second project, B, and index.html, and ""Run on Server again"". 3) Create another ""hello.html file"" in project B, and ""Run on Server"".  I get a 404 error when launching hello.html.  As you know, the Web services wizard causes re-deploys to the server and, in the end-to-end scenario, creates and adds another module to the server also. So, similar to the behaviour after doing the above, we are not able to launch our generated JSPs.  [reply] Comment 8 Seng Phung Lu 2005-07-13 17:45:47 EDT For Tim F.  Thanks!  [reply] Comment 9 Tim deBoer 2005-07-19 16:24:19 EDT Tim - If you are going to fix this for 0.7, please set the target milestone, accept it, and try to get a fix within the next couple days. If that is not your plan, please drop the priority to P4 and provide some justification for why it can't or shouldn't be fixed now. Blocking defects are being reviewed during 0.7 shutdown and we need to resolve this bug one way or the other soon.  [reply] Comment 10 Tim Francis 2005-07-19 19:31:09 EDT I am not able to reproduce this problem, even using the scenario you describe.  I believe that the Geronimo support essentially works now - I do not believe this problem (even if we can find a reproducible scenario) is a blocker for 0.7  [reply] Comment 11 Seng Phung Lu 2005-07-20 12:15:08 EDT Web services are not able to deploy when the server is in the started state. Basically, we get a 404 error because the Axis admin servlet isn't being served.  I suppose the scenario I described may have been inconsistent in reproducing the error. Sorry about that.  Here's what we have been consistently running into using the Web services wizard to start/stop/re-start the server.  1. Create a Geronimo targetted Web project and add a Java bean. 2. Do a Bottom-Up Java bean Web service (click finish in the wizard to accept defaults). 3. Next, leave the server running, get another Java bean and run the Bottom-Up Java Web service wizard again.  A way to check whether or not the Axis admin service is running is by opening the following URL:  http://localhost:8080/*WebApp_ID*/services/AdminService  Note: After step 3, the URL is no longer valid.

Return null? Or should simply return what's in source regardless of the type declared?  [reply] Comment 1 Theodora Yeung 2005-07-11 19:11:20 EDT Fix checked into CVS as of July 11, 2005 4:07pm.  APT implementation will assure that return type of AnnoationValue.getValue() line up with that in the declaration when there are no errors.  In the example below, auto boxing will be performed in the return value. Type widening and narrowing will also be performed when possible. If the type is not convertible, the return type will depends on the value in source. Sun's implementation always return you the String ""error"" but that seems counter intuitive particular when the string could actually be a valid value for some annotation value.

Add the directory to the project root in windows Explorer. Refresh project in Package Explorer.  6. Clean and build again. Problem goes away.  I believe that this has to do with having an entry in the .classpath file for the project, which does not already exist on disk. This will be a problem for anyone who downloads a checked-in project from a source control system with a generated directory already defined in it.  This bug manifested in a Daybreak build from 7/7/2005.  [reply] Comment 1 Mike Kaufman 2005-07-14 18:29:52 EDT  Sent mail to Philipe, Jerome, Dirk & Kent Johnson on this issue.  We need to find some way for our APTPlugin to get called when there's a fatal build error, and we can then try to fix this.  Probably we'll want to update the ICompilationParticipant with a handleBuildError() method or something.  [reply] Comment 2 Mike Kaufman 2005-07-27 17:41:24 EDT  The current suggestion from Phillipe is to use an ""APT nature"".  In this nature's configure() call, we can check to see if the apt-config specifies a generated_src dir and the generated_src dir is on the classpath but doesn't exist on disk.  At this point, we will create the generated src dir.  We will need to account for a default generated_src dir (this may come out of the config UI as an empty string).  I'm investigating this approach.  The biggest thing that isn't clear to me is how/when we will be able to add the APT nature as a project.   [reply] Comment 3 Mike Kaufman 2005-07-28 13:53:29 EDT  Using a nature won't work.  A nature's configure() method is only called on project creation.  We need this called whenever a project is opened.

[reply] Description Ron Bodkin 2005-07-28 03:30:34 EDT I am now getting this warning repeatedly in LTW from CVS HEAD using JRockIt 1.5.0_02. I wasn't seeing this before. Might this have something to do with generics?!  warning at C:\devel\workspace\crankjAgent\src\com\crankj\monitor\resource\JdbcMo nitor.aj:80::0 can not resolve this member: java.lang.Object[] java.util.ArrayLi st.toArray(java.lang.Object[]) [Xlint:unresolvableMember]  I see the same error for other collections too.  I'm also seeing errors reported for unresolved types, which weren't being reported before, and appear to be caused by trying to resolve references to classes that wouldn't normally be referenced by the given classloader, e.g.,  error can't find type org.apache.commons.collections.set.ListOrderedSet  I'm not sure that these are causing any problems, and I need to dig further about the latter but I wanted to mention them in case they are correlated.

[reply] Comment 4 Kai Shen 2005-12-23 13:23:54 EST This problem is caused by incorrect environment setting. Please see the following email that I sent to the submitter two days ago for details. ______________________________________________ From: 	Kai Shen Sent:	Wednesday, December 21, 2005 5:16 PM To:	'hpadmanabhan@mandtbank.com' Cc:	Stanley Wang Subject:	Bugzilla Bug 105853 - Report Viewer sample fails with runtime error when used on application server (JRun4)  The problem is because the application server contains a older version of Rhino's js.jar, while BIRT uses the latest version (1.6RC1). Because the js.jar in the application server is loaded before the one in BIRT, the older version of class org.mozilla.javascript.Context is loaded. Since the older version of class org.mozilla.javascript.Context doesn't contain function initStandardObjects, a runtime java.lang.NoSuchMethodError happened.  To solve this kind of problem, the application server usually provides a configuration to allow loading application's java classes before the app server's.  For WebSphere, there's a class loading policy option. You need to set it to ""PARENT_LAST"". This will force websphere to load the classes in BIRT before WebSphere's classes. Here's the detailed description on how to set it. In the Server Configuration view or Servers view, double-click the server to open it. The server editor opens. Click the Applications tab at the bottom of the editor. In the Applications list box, select the application to modify the class loader settings. In the Classloader mode field, select the class loading mode for the application to PARENT_LAST.  For WebLogic, the weblogic.xml contains a prefer-web-inf-classes element (a sub-element of the container-descriptor element). By default, this element is set to False. You need to set it to TRUE. Setting this element to True subverts the classloader delegation model so that class definitions from the Web application are loaded in preference to class definitions in higher-level classloaders. (http://e-docs.bea.com/wls/docs81/programming/classloading.html#1082452).  For JRUN4, there's a load-system-classes-first element in in the jrun-web.xml. load-system-classes-first specifies whether system classes should be loaded before enterprise and web application classes. If the value is 'true', the system classpath is given preference over the web-app's classpath. If the value is 'false', the local web-app classpath is used to load a class or resource first and if it is not found there, then the system class path is searched. (http://livedocs.macromedia.com/jrun/4/descriptordocs/jrun-web/jrun-web.htm). By default, the value is 'true'. You need to set it to 'false'.  We've tested it in WebLogic 8.1 and WebSphere 5. Please try it out in your environment and let us know if you still have problems. We're planning to close this bug by Friday. Thanks.

with JAX-WS. Unfortunately, there is a remaining difficulty, which is that the JAX-WS annotation processor stores and reads static data that prevents it from being used incrementally.  We're considering creating a compatibility mode inside our implementation allowing processors that are written in this way to function as a batch processor once per clean build.  Ian, if you could only use the JAX-WS annotation processor in Eclipse during a clean build, would that still be useful to you?  [reply] Comment 4 Ian Carr 2005-08-16 06:31:52 EDT Yes I believe so, that would be similar to the way I currently weave in the ant scripts to run APT directly. How would the configuration work? I assume the batch mode would need to be selected for particular generators only, rather than as a global setting?  [reply] Comment 5 Jess Garms 2005-08-16 20:22:25 EDT Yes, we'll need to modify the UI so that it's possible to make a particular processor or processors run only in batch mode. It won't be a global setting.  [reply] Comment 6 Theodora Yeung 2005-08-22 18:42:50 EDT Status update: APT batch dispatch support is in place. Reconcile dispatch is disabled for batch processors.  Remaining items: 1) Need UI 2) Need to bounce class loaders after clean 3) Need to generated IMarker instead of IProblem during batch dispatch.  In short, the jax-ws samples/annotations/src/annotation/server test case should work properly in eclipse at the first clean build.  [reply] Comment 7 Ian Carr 2005-08-23 07:01:57 EDT I am having problems compiling at the moment, should I still be using the APT branches of the jdt.core projects?  in AptCompilationParticipant.java  import org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.PreReconcileCompilationEvent; import org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.PreReconcileCompilationResult;  are reported as ""cannot be resolved"".  I think I have 'uptodated' everything I needed previously?  [reply] Comment 8 Jess Garms 2005-08-23 12:03:31 EDT Ah, sorry about that. I made a change to both jdt.core and jdt.apt, but I don't have permissions on the jdt.core branch, so they're out of synch at the moment. Waiting for some jdt folks to check in the change I submitted. I'll add a comment to this bug once that happens.  [reply] Comment 9 Jess Garms 2005-08-23 16:50:14 EDT Okay, the jdt.core patch has been applied in CVS. You should be able to sync up and build without errors.  [reply] Comment 10 Jess Garms 2005-10-25 18:42:42 EDT The classloader issues should be completely solved at this point, and the UI features an advanced dialog for setting certain processors (factory path entries, really) into batch mode.  However, our rounding model is not quite right. The JAX-WS processors don't seem to get a chance to participate in processing the generated files during a batch build. Assigning to Theodora to investigate.  [reply] Comment 11 Theodora Yeung 2005-10-26 22:27:56 EDT Ian- This may sound silly but does samples/annotations works under Sun's APT? I tried running it with Sun's APT from JDK 1.5.0_04, and got 5 errors. It appears that  AddNumbersIFService, AddNumbers an AddNumbersException_Exception didn't get generated. Thanks.

The classes you mention exist in my generated output for the client. Do I remember that you have to do something special in the original sample build to generate the client components?  I have successfully built and deployed using this setup.  Hope this helps  [reply] Comment 13 Theodora Yeung 2005-10-27 16:47:48 EDT Ian- What are the exact ant targets you ran? I ran the ""server"" target from samples/annotations/build.xml which basically did a ""clean"", ""build-server- jar"", ""create_war"" and ""deploy"". The build-server only ran APT over java file under server.  It would be helpful to know which ant target resulted in the creation of AddNumbersIFService, AddNumbers an AddNumbersException_Exception.  thanks  [reply] Comment 14 Theodora Yeung 2005-10-27 18:36:28 EDT  I finally get the samples/annotation example to build properly. No compile time error and generated 4 files. The 3 client java files (that i was having trouble with) are generated by the wsimport ant task that comes with the jax-ws bundle. I have not tried to figure out what the wsimport ant task does but the fact that it requires an App Server _with_ jax-ws installed to run simply put this outside the boundary of APT.  If there is a repro that involve only commandline APT, I would love to know about it and fix any problems that our implementation may have.  Currently, our implementation's behavior matches exactly what Sun's implementation does. The 3 client files do not get generated and resulted in compile time error on samples/annotations/client/AddNumbersClient.java.  The apt command used is as follow.  apt ""-And=C:\perforce\runtime\jax-ws annotations\samples\annotations\bin"" - sourcepath samples\annotations\src -s samples\annotations\genSrc -d samples\annotations\bin - classpath ""samples\annotations\bin;lib\activation.jar;lib\FastInfoset.jar;lib\j axb-api.jar;lib\jaxb-impl.jar;lib\jaxb-libs.jar;lib\jaxb-xjc.jar;lib\jaxws- api.jar;lib\jaxws-rt.jar;lib\jaxws-tools.jar;lib\jsr173_api.jar;lib\jsr181- api.jar;lib\relaxngDatatype.jar;lib\saaj-api.jar;lib\saaj- impl.jar;lib\sjsxp.jar"" - factorypath ""samples\annotations\bin;lib\activation.jar;lib\FastInfoset.jar;lib \jaxb-api.jar;lib\jaxb-impl.jar;lib\jaxb-libs.jar;lib\jaxb-xjc.jar;lib\jaxws- api.jar;lib\jaxws-rt.jar;lib\jaxws-tools.jar;lib\jsr173_api.jar;lib\jsr181- api.jar;lib\relaxngDatatype.jar;lib\saaj-api.jar;lib\saaj- impl.jar;lib\sjsxp.jar"" samples\annotations\src\annotations\server\*.java samples\annotations\src\annotations\client\*.java   Again, if there is a repro that involves only APT, I would love to know about it. (Don't know why i managed to not get any errors before.) Will be closing this bug after i check in a few changes.  [reply] Comment 15 Theodora Yeung 2005-10-28 21:30:31 EDT Fixed any problem with APT itself but the project will not build in Eclipse as it requires a running AppServer with jax-ws installed.

presently doing another clean install of eclipse 3.1, wtp 1.0 m5, and geronimo plugin.  will later advise how this goes.  suspect it will be fine seeing as how a major step (0.7 vs. 1.0) was munged.

2005-11-04 02:30:34 EST,108892,Load Time Weaving problem with Aspect Definition at 2 Levels of Hierarchy,"Load Time Weaving problem with Aspect Definition at 2 Levels of Hierarchy [reply] Description Ron Bodkin 2005-09-06 22:05:34 EDT I am trying to weave into Tomcat with a system-level aspect (META-INF/aop.xml is found in a jar on the system classpath), and also have a Web application with an aop.xml properly deployed. When I try to run them both together, only the system-level aspects work. If I remove the system-level aspect jar from the classpath, the application-level aspects work. What would be a reasonable way to isolate this into a test case? If I could package up a simple system.jar and app.war file for Tomcat 5.5.9, would that be useful for you to use in debugging it? I tried making a simple standalone version with 2 aop.xml files in the same app classloader but that works just fine.  [reply] Comment 1 Adrian Colyer 2005-09-08 04:18:18 EDT tagging with M4...  [reply] Comment 2 Matthew Webster 2005-09-08 05:48:45 EDT I'm not quite sure I understand the problem: 1. When you say ""weav into Tomcat"" do you mean you are weaving Tomcat classes? 2. When you say ""system classpath"" do you you java.class.path or sun.boot.class.path 3. When you day ""only the system-level aspects work"" do you mean only the Tomcat classes are woven? 4. Could you send the aop.xml files? Are you explicity including/excluding classes or aspects? 5. Could you use weaver options ""-verbose"" and/or ""-showWeavInfo"" and append the resulting logs.  [reply] Comment 3 Ron Bodkin 2005-09-08 20:01:51 EDT Hi Matthew,  1) I have added a jar to the CLASSPATH used on start-up of Tomcat (but not the bootclasspath).

Like that environment I presume Tomcat defines it's own. The problem lies with ClassLoader.getResources() which the AspectJ weaving adaptor uses to find all the available aop.xml files; in your case 2. The bug is that it only finds the first one. You can confirm this using the lastest AspectJ 5 M3, which has lot's of new diagnostic messages, and use ""- Daj.weaving.verbose=true"".  [reply] Comment 5 Ron Bodkin 2005-09-22 17:19:20 EDT I found that both the aop.xml files were being found, so the issue in my case occurred later...  [reply] Comment 6 Matthew Webster 2005-09-23 08:32:59 EDT Could you append the log (or at least the relevant parts)? Do you get weaving messages for the required classes (indicating they are being processed) but no weaveInfo messages (indicating there are no matches)? I assume the classes are not in com.crankj which is excluded or org.aspectj, java or javax which are also exluded automatically.  Have you looked at stderr? If an exception occurs during weaving it will be caught in the adaptor and logged but class loading will continue.  [reply] Comment 7 Alexandre Vasseur 2005-10-24 05:52:18 EDT Ron, can you update the status of this one? Does it still stands or?  [reply] Comment 8 Ron Bodkin 2005-10-25 03:24:44 EDT This is still a bug. I just tried with a recent dev build (Oct. 21) and I see the same behavior: I have a simple trace aspect in my Web application that works with load-time weaving (it is compiled in but there's also an aop.xml file that is showing as weaving when I deploy just the app).  When I add a jar with load-time weaving to the parent classloader's classpath (i.e., Tomcat's shared lib directory), the Web application's LTW aspect no longer has an affect. I cranked up verbose weave information and you can see that the weaver is loading the aop.xml definitions, but it is not applying the advice from the child classloaders'  ... info using aspectpath: [] info zipfile classpath entry does not exist: C:\java\jrockit-jdk1.5.0_03 \jre\lib\i18n.jar info zipfile classpath entry does not exist: C:\java\jrockit-jdk1.5.0_03 \jre\lib\sunrsasign.jar info directory classpath entry does not exist: C:\java\jrockit-jdk1.5.0_03 \jre\classes info register classloader org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperLoader@5075224 info using file:/C:/jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/shared/lib/crankjAgent.jar!/META- INF/aop.xml info using /C:/jakarta-tomcat-5.5.9/webapps/jpetstore/WEB-INF/classes/META- INF/aop.xml  [reply] Comment 9 Alexandre Vasseur 2005-10-28 08:06:04 EDT cannot reproduce see test AtAjLtwTests.testAppContainer() look for AppContainerTest.java in tests/ module see the sandbox to get an hint on how the rather complex test case works (simulates on container with 2 deployed apps, sharing same classname inside like compiled jsp can, with a global aspect, and one local aspect in only one of the deployed app)  [reply] Comment 10 Adrian Colyer 2005-10-28 08:19:02 EDT just moved to P2 to make sure we close this out one way or another before RC1  [reply] Comment 11 Alexandre Vasseur 2005-11-03 04:21:59 EST Ron, can you provide a test case for that one ?

2005-10-20 17:54:41 EDT,110373,Source file generated by annotation processor not updated in IDE,"Source file generated by annotation processor not updated in IDE Description Adrian Grealish 2005-09-22 16:21:25 EDT If a developer has a source file open that is generated by an annotation processor and then changes the processor/factory that generated that file to a different annotation factory implementation (i.e. different jar file == different generated source file) the changes are not reflected in the open source file until it is closed and re-opened in the editor. The project is being rebuilt correctly but this is confusing to developers as they can't see the changes being made if they already have the generated source open. Clicking refresh in the ｀Package Explorer¨ view does not refresh the file in the editor.  Setup steps: Create simple project with simple a class that uses an annotation like @HelloWorld. Create two seperate @HelloWorld processors, one in external Jar A.jar and the other in B.jar, make sure they generate slightly different source at compile time but with the same class and package, one can print 'Hello world A.jar' the other 'Hello World B.jar'. Add them to classpath and to the Annotation Factory Path (Right click on project/Properties/Java Compiler/Annotation Processing/Factory Path/Add External Jars). Add them so A.jar is highier on the list than B.jar so A.jar will be used at compile time.  Repro Steps: Once you have set up your simple project and can see the source file generated by the @HelloWorld annotation processor found in A.jar, open the generated source file in the IDE. Now go into project properties and change the Factory path so that B.jar is higher in the Factory path and apply the changes. This means the project will be re-built with the processor found in B.jar but the generated source displayed in the open file in the editor is still showing the old source generated by A.jar. Clicking refresh on the Package Explorer view does not fix the problem. You have to close the file and reopen it to see the newly generated file by B.jar processor.  Note: When you edit a source file outside of the IDE there is a prompt advising that ｀the file has changed on the file system. Do you want to load the changes?¨  Comment 1 Jess Garms 2005-09-22 16:27:31 EDT Adrian, could you attach A.jar and B.jar to this bug if you have them handy?  Comment 2 Adrian Grealish 2005-10-17 19:23:21 EDT Created attachment 28365 [details] A.jar  This is a simple hello world Annotation factory and processor used to replicate this bug, it generates a file that contain s the phrase ""A.jar"".

I just tested M3 build and it works fine on my machine. For your reference, here are the test steps I did.  1. Download the latest OC4J from http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/htdocs/eaplic.html?http://download.oracle.com/otn/java/oc4j/1013/preview/oc4j_extended_1013_dp4.zip. The version I'm using is 10g (10.1.3.0.0) - Developer Preview 4 (build 050723.1217.03158). I strongly suggest you use 10.1.3 instead of 10.1.2, because 10.1.3 has a very powerful deployment UI which makes deployment much easier than 10.1.2. You can simply type http://<oc4j_host>:8888/em to access the deployment UI (Enterprise Manager).  2. Unzip OC4j and follow the readme.txt to set it up. I'm using JDK 1.4.2 (build 1.4.2_05-b04).  3. Get BIRT M3 build (runtime) from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/birt/downloads/drops/M-R1-2.0M3-200512011059/birt-runtime-2.0M3.zip. Unzip it and get the birt.war in it.  4. Start OC4j and login Enterprise Manager (http://<oc4j_host>:8888/em)  5. Go to Application Tab and click Deploy, and deploy the birt.war we got in step 3. BIRT is deployed successfully.  6. Go to http://<oc4j_host>:8888/birt/ and click the test report. It works fine. Specify the absolute location of another BIRT report in the URL. The new BIRT report is also displayed correctly.  Please give it a try in your environment and let me know if you still have problems.  I'm going to mark this bug as Resolved. Thanks for reporting this issue.

2005-12-08 01:33:32 EST,117404,Separate DocumentArchive into ArchiveReader and ArchiveWriter,"Separate DocumentArchive into ArchiveReader and ArchiveWriter [reply] Description Stanley Wang 2005-11-21 19:32:13 EST Currently, the IDocumentArchive interface supports both read/write. As a result, if there is an init method, it would be different for reader/writer, because in reader, one may have to first decompress a file; Similarly, a finalize method would also work differently. Also, the reader needs a set of getXXX and listXXX functions, but the writer only needs a set of createXXX functions.  The proposal is the separate the interface into two, one for reader and one for writer. The interface has been checked in to BIRT.core. Implementation classes need to be provided.  Classes that currently use the archive interface should be updated sccordingly.  There also needs to be a factory class in BIRT.core to generate an archive, so that users of the API do not need to directly call ""new DocumentArchive()"", which exposes implementation detail. Once you have a factory, in fact, it is possible to have one implementation class that implements both without exposing unwanted functions.  [reply] Comment 1 Kai Shen 2005-12-08 01:33:32 EST A whole new report archive related interfaces and implementations are now implemented. IDocArchiveReader and IDocArchiveWriter interfaces are provided. A FileArchiveReader and FileArchiveWriter class now implements the two interfaces respectively. FileArchiveWriter and FileArchiveReader provides a single (compound) file based implementation for the report archive. The reader is able to hand out multiple streams with random access functionality (hence avoided the problem that zip entry can not be randomly accessed). The reader allows read simultaneously from multiple file pointers, i.e., all the streams are read from the same file, not different files in a folder. At the stream level, we defined RAInputStream and RAOutputstream, which derives from InputStream and OutputStream. Here RA means random access, so you can call seek directly. To use the new interfaces, caller no longer need to get a File and then create an input stream; instead, the stream is directly given to the caller. This is to provide an abstraction so that the caller won't care the low level implementations.  Based on the new report archive, the report document implementation is also updated. And report engine (api, api/impl, data, executor, presentation), DtE and viewer code are changed accordingly too.

2005-11-22 00:58:56 EST,117416,The ease of plugin deployment in BIRT development environment doesn't finished yet,"The ease of plugin deployment in BIRT development environment doesn't finished yet [reply] Description Sue Lee 2005-11-21 22:05:34 EST The ease of plugin deployment in BIRT development environment doesn't finished yet.  [reply] Comment 1 Wei Yan 2005-11-21 23:36:19 EST assign to kshen as Sue's request.  [reply] Comment 2 Kai Shen 2005-11-22 00:58:56 EST Before the fix, when viewer is running in the embedded Tomcat in BIRT Designer, server platform is used to get plugin information, build extension registry and load classes. In order for server platform to parse plugin, a BIRT_HOME (i.e. where the plugins are located) needs to be provided. Currently, the BIRT_HOME is set to the viewer's plugins folder. That's why the latest version of the plugins must be put under viewer's plugins folder.  In order not to copy plugins into viewer's plugin folder, we need to get plugin information and load classes from Eclipse workspace instead of an arbitrary disk location like BIRT_HOME. Since server platform can not do it, the Eclipse platform needs to be used. Eclipse platform is able to get all the plugin information and load the classes from workspace because through project configuration, Eclipse platform is aware of all the external plugins (i.e. plugins under Eclipse's plugin folder) as well as the workspace plugins (i.e. plugins included in the current workspace).  To use Eclipse platform when viewer is running in the embedded Tomcat in BIRT Designer, we can simply remove all the BIRT related jar files from viewer\birt\web-inf\lib folder. To understand why it works, we need to look at the classloading of the embedded viewer first. The embedded viewer is running in Tomcat, hence a class is loaded by Tomcat classloader first. If a class can not be loaded by Tomcat, the Eclipse's PluginClassloaderWrapper will be used which will load viewer and its dependency plugin from Eclipse workspace. When the birt related jar files are removed from web-inf\lib folder, the Tomcat classloader can not load birt.core, and the PluginClassloaderWrapper is used. Since birt.core was loaded already when the Designer started and the Eclipse platform (instead of server platform) was used, Eclipse's PluginClassloaderWrapper simply return the Eclipse platform. With this Eclipse platform, all the BIRT plugins/classes are loaded from the workspace instead of the viewer's plugin folder. So, the solution is to removing the birt related JAR files from the web-inf/lib folder in the embedded viewer.  This checkin changed the build script as follows.  It implemented the new build viewer script which only builds viewer itself. This new build script will be used for the embedded viewer. It also changed the original build viewer to build web viewer which copies birt related Jar file to lib folder and plugins to plugins folder (the same behavior as before). This script will be used to build the WAR file for viewer.  [reply] Comment 3 Sue Lee 2005-11-24 02:08:19 EST Verified in daily build 20051124. Finished.

2006-01-18 04:28:46 EST,119128,WebSphere v6.0 API jars not added,"WebSphere v6.0 API jars not added [reply] Description Harold Gartner 2005-12-02 16:27:01 EST Using wtp-1.0RC1 I am trying to use 'IBM WebSphere v6.0' as a new server runtime, and then use it as the target runtime for a Connector project, or a Utility project.  When I press finish on the 'Connector Import' wizard, nothing happens in the wizard at all (I can press finish forever - well something is happening see below).  When I try to define 'IBM WebSphere v6.0' as the 'Target runtime' in the 'Utility Module' wizard, I get an error message 'Invalid target server selected', after pressing 'finish' in the 'New Server Runtime' wizard.  If I look in the .log file after trying to do the rar import, there are only 2 messages: !ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core 4 0 2005-12-02 15:48:25.411 !MESSAGE Runtime component type was.base has not been defined.

only j2ee.jar, and not all the jars in the 'lib' directory of the WebSphere installation, is the only jar file added to the build path of the server runtime container.  I would expect all the jar files to be there.  We have code which programmatically sets the the runtime container on the project, and I only get j2ee.jar on the classpath.  [reply] Comment 1 Neeraj Agrawal 2005-12-05 10:23:43 EST The import of connector has been fixed for RC2. For the utility project creation please follow 116495  [reply] Comment 2 Arthur Ryman 2005-12-05 11:40:19 EST Added to Hit List at the request of Harold Gartner. I've increased the priority to P2 in case you reopen.  [reply] Comment 3 Harold Gartner 2005-12-12 14:29:43 EST This bug is not entirely fixed in RC2.  In the original text:  ""One more thing which is not working (although it may once the above is corrected), is that only j2ee.jar, and not all the jars in the 'lib' directory of the WebSphere installation, is the only jar file added to the build path of the server runtime container.  I would expect all the jar files to be there.""  All of the jar file in the lib directory need to be set on the container's classpath.  Otherwise the code we generate won't compile as is references classes outside of j2ee.jar.  Creating a basic J2EE runtime library adds all of the jars in the specified directory to the container classpath.  I would assume that targetting a Webshpere server should be doing exactly the same thing.  [reply] Comment 4 Neeraj Agrawal 2005-12-12 15:10:46 EST Also, see  Bugzilla 116495  [reply] Comment 5 Arthur Ryman 2005-12-12 16:03:28 EST Tim, on the RC4 call today, I believe you said you would close this.  [reply] Comment 6 Tim deBoer 2005-12-12 16:04:33 EST Discussed on today's WTP 1.0 shutdown call. Since the original blocking bug has been fixed and we do not plan to fix the remaining problem in 1.0, it is being deferred. The workaround for now is to manually add the required jars to the classpath.  [reply] Comment 7 Arthur Ryman 2006-01-12 20:20:16 EST Sinan, can you fix this in 1.0.1? Thx.  [reply] Comment 8 Naci Dai 2006-01-17 11:08:26 EST Sinan can you report on the status of this bug.  Is it fixed?

The engine used to return a null IRowSet if there was no row before, I believe it should not throw an exception in any case when we try to evaluate the expression. Reassigning to data team.  [reply] Comment 2 jluo 2005-12-27 20:00:35 EST IRowSet is provided by Engine team.  [reply] Comment 3 David Michonneau 2005-12-28 05:44:17 EST Reassigning to engine team. Some suggestions from Zhiqiang:  Current IDataRowExpressionEvaluator.first() doesn¨t have a return value. This causes a bug in DataProcessor when binding the data. The code is in mapToChartResultSet():    idre.first( );    do  {  oaTuple = new Object[iColumnCount];  it = co.iterator( );  iColumnIndex = 0;  while ( it.hasNext( ) )  {  oaTuple[iColumnIndex++] = idre.evaluate( (String) it.next( ) );  }  liResultSet.add( oaTuple );  } while ( idre.next( ) );    So with this, even the IRowSet doesn¨t have any row, the chart ResultSet will have one null row, this is not correct.    I think we should change it to Boolean first(); And also you can see in java.sql.ResultSet, the first() method has a return value to indicate if current cursor is in a valid position.    And after we change the interface. This code will be:    boolean hasFirst = idre.first( );    if ( hasFirst )  {  do  {  oaTuple = new Object[iColumnCount];  it = co.iterator( );  iColumnIndex = 0;  while ( it.hasNext( ) )  {  oaTuple[iColumnIndex++] = idre.evaluate( (String) it.next( ) );  }  liResultSet.add( oaTuple );  } while ( idre.next( ) );  }    Now it will be correct for this case.    This change will involve all the IDataRowExpressionEvaluator implementation, including SqlDataRowEvaluator, BirtDataRowEvaluator, and one anonymous implementation in ChartUIUtil.  [reply] Comment 4 Zhiqiang Qian 2005-12-28 21:55:40 EST Fixed. Changed IDataRowExpressionEvaluation interface and implementaion, added return value for first() method.

[reply] Comment 1 Kai Shen 2006-01-04 20:14:17 EST The readInt method of RandomAccessFile makes 4 calls to system, and the calls are not buffered. Since report archive is based on RandomAccessFile and function readInt is called very frequently (for each object) while reading the report document, we added a buffer to reduce the system IO calls from 4 to 1. Unit tests show the performance for function readInt() is now 3.5 times faster than before.  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",kshen@actuate.com

2006-01-25 12:41:39 EST,124042,server.getLaunchConfiguration returns null,"server.getLaunchConfiguration returns null [reply] Description Sachin Patel 2006-01-16 17:22:34 EST In the following scenario server.getLaunchConfiguration returns null even if ""true"" is passed in for the create parameter.  I have an server editor sections that calls getLaunchConfiguration.  If I...  (1) Define a geronimo server (2) Open the server editor (3) Shutdown the workbench (keeping the editor open) (4) Restart the workbench  At which point the server editor fails to create due to a failure in my section since it cannot create an instanceof the launchConfiguration.  Then If you close the editor and re-open it then the editor appears succesfully, it only fails on workbench restart if the editor is left open on the previous session.  [reply] Comment 1 Tim deBoer 2006-01-16 21:42:10 EST I couldn't reproduce on 1.0.1 after trying several times and using a few of the different servers in WTP. I'll try again shortly on a 1.5 build, but let me know if you track it down any further in the meantime.  [reply] Comment 2 Sachin Patel 2006-01-16 21:58:17 EST It only happens if a server editor section is added that has code that calls getLaunchConfiguration.  I was able to produce it on a 1.0 driver, let me move up to 1.0.1 and see if it happens to resolved.  [reply] Comment 3 Sachin Patel 2006-01-17 09:40:19 EST Yes this happens on 1.0.1 as well.  If you want you can reproduce on Geronimo by installing the geronimo server adapter from here.  http://cvs.apache.org/dist/geronimo/eclipse/unstable/  (1) Define a geronimo server. (2) Open its editor (3) Shutdown workbench (4) Restart workbench (5) The open editor has an error. You have to close the editor and reopen it for it to open succusfully.  If you put a breakpoint in SetConsoleLogLevelCommand.getLaunchConfiguration() you will see that on workbench startup it returns null even though ""create"" is set to true.  I don't understand the code for getLaunchConfiguration so I'm not sure whats causing it exacly.  [reply] Comment 4 Tim deBoer 2006-01-18 10:44:49 EST Found the problem. The workaround for bug 91333 was failing in this case because the platform does an undocumented suspend/resume of the Job queue during UI startup, and Job.join() has a failure in that it silently does not join() if the Job queue is suspended.  Removed workaround for 91333, which appears to have been fixed by the platform team. That fixes this bug, so I'll check it in.

When creating a project, the target runtime does not apply.  The project shows an emtpy server classpath container. When checking the defined runtimes in preferences, the runtime is defined, however, its ""location"" is being lost.  This is only happens on the Geronimo Runtime.  My initial thought was that something was broken I changed, however, when simply backleveling my target to a previous I-driver, the problem did not occur.  [reply] Comment 1 Sachin Patel 2006-01-25 14:34:22 EST Keep in mind I am no longer using the generic wizard fragment and I have reused some of the behavior in the ServerTypeDefinitionRuntimeDecorator to set the app server location.  It may be that the generic implementation changed to save the runtime and I need to react as well.  [reply] Comment 2 Sachin Patel 2006-01-25 14:35:47 EST Created attachment 33614 [details] Geronimo implementation of runtime wizard fragment  Adding attachment to see if you stop anything immediatly.  [reply] Comment 3 Sachin Patel 2006-01-25 14:53:04 EST After stepping through when creating the target runtime, the following call I making seems to set the property map.  getRuntimeDelegate().setServerInstanceProperties(getValues());  Stepping over on the validate before the wizard finishes, I inspect getRuntimeDelegate() and it does contain the map with the serverLocation value.  The behavior is the same on both the working and broken driver.  I don't think its my code.  [reply] Comment 4 Tim deBoer 2006-01-25 15:46:59 EST Fix checked into CVS. I very carefully made an API change, deprecated old methods, ... and missed delegating some of the old methods to the new methods.  [reply] Comment 5 Sachin Patel 2006-01-26 10:27:49 EST What do i need to pull this fix in?  I didn't see a 1.0.1 branch in CVS so I checked out wst.server.core and jst.server.core from HEAD, but that didn't seem to pull in the fix.

2006-03-28 21:02:45 EST,131020,Design file compatibility test (phase 1),"Design file compatibility test (phase 1) [reply] Description Rock Yu 2006-03-08 21:58:07 EST BIRT Designer should be able to open and layout reports files written use previous BIRT releases. We should test the current release against design files generated with major releases as: R1.0.0, R1.0.1, R2.0.0, and R2.0.1.  The test files can be chosen from previous acceptance or smoke test cases, and we will improve the coverage gradually.  Prepare a bunch of design files that are created with the major releases categorized by their version. Here are several tips and rules:  1) For an old design file say report_v1.0.0.rptdesign, open it with some latest Designer R1.0.1, do some minor change, then save it. The design structure will be automatically upgraded into R1.0.1 version. So the new file saved as report_v1.0.1 can be save as test file for R1.0.1  2) Choose the test file with care. Once a design file is choosen as compatibility test file, it will be tested throughout the production lifecycle, and never changed again. A build should pass all the compatibility test before it can be released.  3) Try to cover most of the new features that were added in the latter release. For example, add design with styles into R1.0.0 and design with Theme into R2.0.0.  4) It's okay and sometimes recommended that the test design files have some semantic warnings. Designer will allow reports with warnings but refuse to open reports with errors. So for test purpose, we should try design files with some warnings to make ensure that designer will always tolerate a warning.  [reply] Comment 1 Rock Yu 2006-03-16 00:36:54 EST Shasha:  Compatibility test should also include the sample reports that we publish with BIRT.

However, to support using report document as data source, and potentially even replace the report document during rendering, an interface/class that supports both read and write with the same object is needed.  Because BIRT internal codes uses archive reader and writer frequently, it is desirable that the new class implements both the reader and writer interfaces. The implementation class could contain a reader and a writer class, and implement the two interfaces through delagation. But this is not a requirement, but just a suggestion.  The interface shuld also support a method isOpen() for checking whether the archive is already open.  The interface should support file lock, i.e., read/write file lock.  The class for now does not need to support synchronization between read/write. It is the caller's responsibility to do so, using the lock mechanism/method on the archive.  Because the archive is a folder, concurrently read/write is an exception, instead of norm.  [reply] Comment 1 Kai Shen 2006-03-29 13:55:11 EST Resolution Comment: A FolderArchive class that supports both read and write within the same object was implemented and added into birt.core.

In 3.1.2 defect 107909 prevented me from shutting down the workbench after each invocation, and the workaroud was for me to set the noShutdown property to true.  (However even though this worked there were issues later on).  So with 107909 fixed I moved up to the 3.2.0 M5 build.  The first invocation to the headless application works fine, then immediatley during the build the headless app is invoked again but on the second call it fails with the following exception:  java.lang.NullPointerException at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.setResolved(PackageAdminImpl.java:282) at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.applyDeltas(PackageAdminImpl.java:297) at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.processDelta(PackageAdminImpl.java:370) at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.doResolveBundles(PackageAdminImpl.java:191) at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl$1.run(PackageAdminImpl.java:139) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:552)  [reply] Comment 1 Thomas Watson 2006-03-27 11:38:40 EST Can you provide us steps to reproduce.  From the stacktrace it seems the state thinks there is a resolved host bundle for a fragment but the actual Bundle object for the host cannot be found in the framework.  This should not be possible.  Are you manipulating the system state of the framework somehow?  [reply] Comment 2 Sachin Patel 2006-03-27 12:44:57 EST My current workaround for 3.1.2 was to set PROP_NOSHUTDOWN to true and call EclipseStarter.run(args, null) on the first invocation and then EclipseStarter.run(args) there after.  In 3.1.2 between calls I was able to call different applications by setting the system property eclipse.application.  In 3.2 this is no longer, as if I go back to using the workaround its always calling the same application and my scenario calls for calling different applications.  (Not sure if this is the intent or if this is a bug). So for 3.2 I am currently broken as I cannot startup the workbench multiple times within Maven due to the exception below nor can I use the workaround to keep the platform alive.  [reply] Comment 3 Sachin Patel 2006-03-27 14:06:05 EST I don't think I'm modifying the state. This is happening in the context of Maven, so let me see if I can extract the code out into a standalone java app as a test case and see if the problem occurs.  [reply] Comment 4 Sachin Patel 2006-03-28 10:55:52 EST Created attachment 37089 [details] TestCase showing exception  Attached is the test case showing the NPE exception.  You can import the contents of the zip as a project in your workspace and launch it as a java app.  You will need to modify the ECIPSE_HOME var to point to Eclipse 3.2 M5 + WTP 1.0.1.  Also change WORKSPACE to your preference.  The test case shows the the first invocation to run() works fine as the usage is printed out for the given application.  Then immediately run() is invoked again but this time fails with the NPE. This mimics the behavior of how the code is invoked within the maven context.  [reply] Comment 5 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 12:19:57 EST Thanks for the testcase.  This will greatly help us in solving the problem.  I want to confirm that you are using the same EclipseStarter class to relaunch the Equinox framework in maven.  As a workaround you may consider creating a new URLClassLoader for each launch of equinox.  With that said I'm not satisfied with the workaround and we should look to solve this problem in 3.2.  [reply] Comment 6 Sachin Patel 2006-03-28 12:24:36 EST Thanks.  Yes I am using the EclipseStarter each time.  How do I go about creating a new URLClassLoader for each launch? Is there a snippit of code that you could provide?  [reply] Comment 7 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 12:46:29 EST The project equinox-incubator/org.eclipse.equinox.servlet.bridge.launcher has a class FrameworkLauncher that creates a new URLClassLoader for the purpose of launching multiple frameworks in the same VM.  You should take a look at that example to see if you can reuse some of that work.  [reply] Comment 8 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 13:12:36 EST The root of the problem is in a static initializer from the Class BaseStorage  private static final BaseStorage INSTANCE = new BaseStorage();  We need to make sure a new instance of BaseStorage is used for each instance of the framework.  I hope to get a patch ready in time for M6.  [reply] Comment 9 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 15:11:18 EST Created attachment 37133 [details] patch  This patch gets rid of the ugly static initializer in BaseStorage.  Instead the BaseStorageHook is responsible for constructing the instance of BaseStorage to be used by the framework instance.  [reply] Comment 10 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 15:12:15 EST Pascal/DJ please review patch for M6.

I am running into another issue though regarding if a second invocation lauches a different application, the application from the previous launch runs, rather then the new one.  Currently I'm just setting the system property for the application id, but let me pass the property via setInitialProperties() instead as well as using a different URLClassLoader as you suggested to see if this resolves it before I open a issue on this.  [reply] Comment 13 Thomas Watson 2006-03-28 18:54:12 EST Released patch for M6.  I'm not sure I understand why the previous app is being launched instead of the next one when you launch a second framework.  It would be interesting to investigate this issue (in another bug report of coarse ;-)  [reply] Comment 14 Sachin Patel 2006-03-29 10:54:48 EST Sorry :( I'm going to have to re-open this.  The patch fixes the stand-alone test case, but the NPE still occurs when running within Maven.  I don't know why... the launch code is the same.  One difference is that Maven is putting the org.eclipse.osgi jar in the classpath (but the location is from the maven repository) but the osgi.framework property is set to point to the osgi jar in the eclipse/plugins, even though both jars are the same do you think this would cause a problem?  [reply] Comment 15 Sachin Patel 2006-03-29 11:08:10 EST Actually I think that was the problem :) If I take out the parent classloader (maven) it works :)  [reply] Comment 16 Eclipse Webmaster 2007-07-29 09:19:20 EDT Changing OS from Mac OS to Mac OS X as per bug 185991  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",sppatel2@gmail.com

QA's test plug-ins also need some changes.  We need to rewrite the build scripts for each test plug-ins. Here is the requirements:  1. Public targets Each build file should define the several public targets:  a) UnitTest b) APIJavadoc c) Clean d) Report  2. Private targets Follow the names:  e) compileTest (depend on f) ) f) buildDependents g) utest (for develop usage, depend on b),c),d) )  3. Integration Work with build team, integrate the test with daily build, we should be able to see the log and test result from our build page.  4. Misc 1) Move reusable logic or script code into our ""org.eclipse.birt.tests.core"" plugin 2) The caller(daily build) should be able to redirect all the outputs like logs, reports etc. These path should be defined as variables.  [reply] Comment 1 Xiang Li 2006-05-28 03:41:17 EDT added build.xml for tests.model and tests.engine. unable to do it for tests.data, as it is lack of maintenance. please log a bug for that.

My report data is structured through the use of grids. So if a certain condition is true; I must hide a specific grid, if it is false, then something else must be hidden. Can u assist please????????  [reply] Comment 1 Ivy Li 2006-05-19 03:43:01 EDT can you help?  [reply] Comment 2 Wenbin He 2006-05-23 14:54:26 EDT I don't think that BIRT support conditional format for grid. But I think you can control the content to hide/show inside grid cells.  [reply] Comment 3 Wenfeng Li 2006-05-30 21:25:03 EDT You can wirte a script in a report item's onCreate() method to set/unset the visibility of a grid report item.  Similar script can also be written for report item that is inside a grid to hide the report item in that grid cell.

We currently use the following hack to startup up the JSD service: // debuggerService.on(); // will crash. can only be called from JS // do this instead: String jsdObserverCID = ""2fd6b7f6-eb8c-4f32-ad26-113f2c02d0fe""; nsIObserver jsdObserver = (nsIObserver) Mozilla.getInstance() .getComponentManager().createInstance(jsdObserverCID, null, nsIObserver.NS_IOBSERVER_IID); jsdObserver.observe(null, """", """");  This is basically what setInitAtStartup() does under the covers, but this hack is more direct.

2007-10-09 21:22:52 EDT,145865,Install is not consistent with other Eclipse projects,"Install is not consistent with other Eclipse projects [reply] Description Lawrence Mandel 2006-06-07 16:16:34 EDT ATF currently requires that users download the Dojo and Rico libraries and add them to the respective personality plug-ins (in the resources folder). When installing ATF 0.1 this was difficult because the personality plug-ins and jarred. To install these libraries a user either needs to add them to the jar or extract the jar.  I expected that these personality plug-ins would be expanded as folders in the plug-ins directory.  [reply] Comment 1 Lawrence Mandel 2006-06-07 16:44:25 EDT Turns out I didn't follow the directions correctly. I simply downloaded and unzipped into the eclipse directory instead of treating the download as a local update site. I did this because this is the way other Eclipse project downloads are used. I've updated the summary of this bug to reflect this. I think the downloads from the ATF project should be simply unzipped into the install directory as is Eclipse convention.  [reply] Comment 2 Gino Bustelo 2006-06-07 17:15:26 EDT We use the Archived Site approach because we need to bring in other dependencies that are hosted elsewhere (not in Eclipse.org). We are leveraging Eclipse Update/Install system for this to try to make the install almost a one step thing (as far as licensing allows).  We will look into how much effort it would be to do a simple unzip install (in terms of the user).  Good point... I agree that this is how most of the Eclipse projects do it.  [reply] Comment 3 Bill Higgins 2006-06-28 09:34:24 EDT Naive question: is it possible to work out agreements with the other organizations so that their components *can* be hosted on eclipse.org as part of the Eclipse install?  I personally prefer to download components like ATF into some folder and  link it into my Eclipse install via a .link file rather than update manager.  [reply] Comment 4 ccocchiaro@nexaweb.com 2006-09-21 14:12:21 EDT This is actually quite a problem since we use an automated ant build to create an InstallAnywhere executable for our product and it needs to install ATF (and the associated runtime files) once it's  extracted Eclipse and WTP into the users' install location.  The only way we can currently install ATF is by extracting the files from the ATF zip/gz/tar file into the Eclipse installation directories.  We either need a way to install it from InstallAnywhere using this Archive Site mechanism or we need a zip that includes all the files (external ones as well) so that we can extract them from our install executable.  I don't know of any other way to distribute ATF with our product.  [reply] Comment 5 Robert Goodman 2006-09-21 21:49:17 EDT We don't have a short-term solution to this problem. The process for getting approval to put third party software on eclipse is very long. We first have to get PMC approval to submit the paper work to begin the legal review by eclipse. We have done this. Then the third party software has to go through a legal review from the eclipse lawyers. Eclipse has limited legal resources, so these reviews can take time. After it is reviewed and approved by the lawyers, it has to be submitted to the eclipse board for approval. I think the Eclipse board meets 4 times a year. If we decide to go up to a new version of a third party package, we have to go through another a legal review and then submit it to the board for approval. In the time we first put ATF on eclipse, we have moved up to a new version of Dojo, Rico, Prototype, and JSLint. We are in looking at  moving up to a new version of XPCom and Zimbra. It looks like the eclipse legal process would be a big hindrance. We are in the discussion with the eclipse legal team to see if there is a way to short circuit the process.  We are studying other possible solutions to the problem. Such as preference wizards that would allow a developer to specifying a location of the runtime instead of just having to copy it into the plugin. An example would be WTP support for Tomcat. We would still use Update Manger because some of the third party like XPCom, Rhino would still be on other sites. At this point my guess is that we will come up with some other solution than packaging the third party software in the zip file.  ATF is open source you can download the source and build your own package with the third party software included.  [reply] Comment 6 ccocchiaro@nexaweb.com 2006-09-22 07:22:42 EDT Please let me know if the following strategy would work or not as a short-term resolution to this issue:  1. Install Eclipse 3.2/WTP 1.5.0 using all-in-one zip 2. Run Eclipse and install ATF manually using Archive Site mechanism 3. Manually copy additional ATF runtime files into Eclipse directory structure using AT installation instructions 4. Create new zip file using the final Eclipse directory structure 5. Unzip new zip file automatically using InstallAnywhere executable  I'm not sure if anything else happens during ATF install related to Windows Registry, etc... so that's why I'm inquiring as to whether this will work or not.  Thanks!  [reply] Comment 7 Lawrence Mandel 2006-09-22 09:17:09 EDT As an alternative to bundling the AJAX frameworks with Eclipse (if you haven't already investigated this), how about working with the AJAX projects to create update sites at the projects? For example, Dojo can host an update site that Eclipse users can use to install Dojo into ATF. This means less legal approval from Eclipse and offloading the management of Dojo updates to Dojo. This approach is similar to the approach WTP has taken with server adapters because we cannot maintain all the requested server adapters.  [reply] Comment 8 Robert Goodman 2006-09-22 11:29:58 EDT You should be able to make you proposed steps to build a zip file to work. I have zipped up an eclipse install before and moved it to a new machine. As far as I know eclipse doesn't use the registry, but it does have a configuration directory <eclipse_install_dir>/configuration. You should probably look in that directory to see if there is any that will cause problems. Make sure you start eclipse with ""eclipse -clean"" before creating the zip file.  We have try to get  the AJAX runtimes projects to put the plugins on there sites. That is why Zimbra plugin is out the Zimbra site, but most of the vendors weren't interested.  [reply] Comment 9 Philippe Ombredanne 2007-10-09 21:22:52 EDT The latest builds of ATF do not include personalities anymore for better or worse. And the xulrunners are shipped with it. I think this bug is no longer relevant. Closing.  [reply] Comment 10 Lawrence Mandel 2007-10-09 23:37:29 EDT Philippe, how about my comments in comment #1? Does the ATF install still require extracting to a local location and using that location as an update site instead of simply unzipping into the eclipse dir?  [reply] Comment 11 Robert Goodman 2007-10-10 10:34:55 EDT ATF now provides all-in-ones and versions that can be unzipped on top of an existing eclipse installs. ATF also has preference pages for configuring Ajax runtimes which means copying of the runtimes are no longer required.  [reply] Comment 12 Lawrence Mandel 2007-10-10 10:47:06 EDT Thanks Bob.

This must have been cut and pasted from some Microsoft product -- there were all sorts of nasty MsNormal font setup items and weird spacing.  I cleaned all that up.  I also tweaked the wording so that -- to be more consistent with the rest of OpenUP -- there was less talk of ""you"" should do this with ""your team"".  It is not a particularly ""wrong"" style or anything, but it felt different than most of the other content.  I tacked on one sentence to the Main Description.  It kind of ended with ""you might not be able to do all of this..."".  I tacked on something along the lines of ""partial adherence to this guideline will add value if you can't do it all"".  We should discuss one additional thing I did.  I didn't like having a link out to the Ambysoft page in the middle of the text.  We have links to other OpenUP elements all over the place and linking white papers in this way rubbed me wrong.  Perhaps we should add a proper reference in the references and have a link to that.

I reworked the last sentence a fair bit.  I may have lost the original intent as a result. I'm just not convinced that a change request needs to be posted, although I suppose if a developer test effort reveals a previously undiscovered bug then I guess that would be the case. Could you please think about it and update appropriately? 2. Do a quick review of everything else to ensure that I addressed your comments?  Thanks.  [reply] Comment 9 Jim Ruehlin 2006-09-21 13:52:58 EDT I'm fine with the changes to Verify Test Results. I agree that in a developer test you often may not want to report the bug, you just go ahead and fix it. But if it's too big or peripheral you may want to report it and deal with it later. I'd be fine if you changed the wording to reflect that the common action would be to just fix it.  The step Evaluate Execution of Test is still a little hard to understand. We should make it clearer that we need to do 2 things: (1) assure the test itself worked, and (2) if it worked assure the software-under-test worked. I think the current wording makes it hard to understand that you're doing (1) until you get the the next step.  [reply] Comment 10 Scott Ambler 2006-09-25 18:13:31 EDT Updated.  To address the bugs pertaining to this task I did a major rework of it.  Jim, could you please review? Thanks.  [reply] Comment 11 Jim Ruehlin 2006-09-26 11:11:16 EDT 1.

Problem was that some of the methods in JSDebugThread are callbacks on a separate thread, but they can get called after the debugger has terminated.  For these two methods, I added a check to JSDebugTarget.isTerminated().  Are most of the methods in this class callbacks?  Should all of them have this check?  [reply] Comment 3 Javier Pedemonte 2006-07-07 18:10:49 EDT Created attachment 45975 [details] JSDebugTarget patch  OK, I think I found out the real fix for this.  When JSDebugTarget.terminate() is called, it first calls shutdown(), then goes through each JSDebugThread and terminates them.  However, shutdown() was setting the _threads array to zero length first, so none of the threads were ever getting terminated.  This had the effect that the Eclipse debugger framework would later call in to some of these JSDebugThreads, thinking they were still active.  Now, with this fix, the debugger framework sees that the threads are terminated, and doesn't call into them.  This also seems to fix another issue that Bob was seeing, where under certain instances, the debugger wouldn't stop on breakpoints.  Bob, try out this patch and see if it works for you.  The method JSDebugThread.disconnect() is similar to terminate(), but the call to JSDebugThread.terminate() is commented out, with a TODO.  Adam, is this your change?  Should that be uncommented?  I'm not sure if this fixes the ""removeObserver"" exception, since I haven't been able to recreate.  [reply] Comment 4 Robert Goodman 2006-07-10 10:23:55 EDT The patch fixes problem of the debugger not stopping on braekpoint when you click on a process to terminate the application. It doesn't fix the problem when you click on the thread to terminate the application. This seems to be a cause by the method handleDebugEvents in JSDebugTarget. It is also clearing the threads before calling terminate.

2006-08-23 11:47:35 EDT,152979,Optimization: Reference Use and URL Caching in ClassLoader Repository,"Optimization: Reference Use and URL Caching in ClassLoader Repository [reply] Description Ron Bodkin 2006-08-07 11:04:12 EDT I have found that a lot of memory can get pinned by the BCEL ClassLoaderRepository. For example, on a test configuration of Glassbox with WebLogic over 40 megabytes were pinned in memory due to this loader. (*)  I also notice that some of the time spent with loading and parsing redundant classes for shared weaving configuration could be reduced by having a global cache of bytes for URL's instead, i.e., the ClassLoaderRepository is local to a loader, so even if the same class on disk is resolved multiple times in different loaders, it isn't read from cache. This latter issue will be reduced if loading types from a parent loader use reflection delegates instead but BCEL still has to be used for aspects on <1.5 VM's...  The attached patch has some metrics in it to measure what's happening and it also uses SoftReferences to cache without pinning the reference types and uses a two-step look up process to maintain a global URL cache. When I run this on WebLogic 9.2 with Glassbox and view their admin console and some smaller apps I get this output:  BCEL repository total load time: 7733 ms, in url: 6029 ms for 1427 url cache hits = 1683 missEvicted = 0 missUrlEvicted= 0 all misses = 1427, loader hits = 0  On Tomcat 5.5 with some different sample apps: BCEL repository total load time: 4945 ms, in url: 4319 ms for 636 url cache hits = 548 missEvicted = 0 missUrlEvicted= 190 all misses= 446, loader hits = 3  So at least in my configuration the URL-based cache is quite effective (with almost a 50% hit rate) whereas the loader-based cache provides little value. From what I've seen, it's worth considering not even using the loader-based BCEL cache at all but others may have configurations where it helps.

[reply] Comment 2 Ron Bodkin 2006-08-07 11:08:33 EDT I should point out that I haven't tested this approach in a build-time weaving or IDE environment. However, I'd be happy to do so after hearing some feedback on it.  [reply] Comment 3 Andrew Clement 2006-08-08 07:31:05 EDT patches applied - slightly reworked it - hope I haven't broken it - my rudimentary tests confirm it is behaving but I don't have any decent ltw configs.  I had to remove nanoTime - that's a 1.5 api, I'm not sure how accurate the totals will be with currentTimeMillis().  stats have to be requested, they aren't dumped out every X seconds, could make this configurable if we're unsure it's behaving.  A system property can turn off the sharing if it starts misbehaving (org.aspectj.apache.bcel.useSharedCache=false)  I don't currently see how keys/values are ever removed from the URL cache - i know they are smaller since only softrefs on one end, but we should be tidying up.  Maybe a queue and tidy up when queue isn't empty and a load/find is attempted.  Don't think it's relevant for command line one off compilation (one world) but AJDT may benefit from something similar when there are multiple AspectJ projects.  [reply] Comment 4 Ron Bodkin 2006-08-08 11:31:58 EDT You're right: the URL cache should probably be managed with a size limit or timing scheme to evict items. Using references would just mean the whole cache could be evicted when memory is low (nothing is going to have a handle on the URL's normally), so you could just have a soft reference to the cache as a whole.  I remember you had brought up some other LRU cache that's in Eclipse that might be suitable for use with the type map. Would that help here?  [reply] Comment 5 Ron Bodkin 2006-08-08 15:15:01 EDT I tested with AspectJ from CVS HEAD including this improved version of the repository code and it is working well, and improving performance. My profile shows that of 27.4 million bytes pinned by AspectJ the static cache is pinning 32k, so it's a pretty low memory user. However, it is better to clean up, so I added that logic and also added some tests.  I don't want to use a reference queue to clean up because then we'd need a reverse map from references to URLs. Instead, I just compress the repository every N accesses, iterating over it and purging any entry with a null value. I also added a property to allow changing the frequency of compaction. To disable it, set the value to zero.  Also, this static map has to be thread-safe (to avoid concurrent errors when so I updated the code to use a concurrent map. I just copied & pasted code from LTWWorld, but it would be better to make a public method makeConcurrentMap() on some ConcurrentFactory class that's shared between the bcel and weaver modules. I also made a small update (to track whether the map is synchronized, so we can synchronize the purge operation). In what module should the shared class go?  Note: the timings in the multi-threaded tests are not accurate in that they count elapsed time per thread, i.e., the threads are often waiting to run at the same time, so the times reported are four times too big. Even with heavy contention (with a quite high compacting frequency), a fairly big cache, and extremely frequent updates the time spent compacting is tiny (<10 ms in a total of 34 seconds, with a ridiculuous frequency of 1 in 10 it's only 170 ms).  I also proved that the multi-threaded tests were testing the right thing: I forgot to set the flag for is this a shared map and got a concurrent modification exception in that case (that's just a problem in the test case, which I fixed).

Do you know of somebody artificially holding onto the URL objects meaning the keys/values will never get cleared?  Or are you concerned that a WeakHashMap may be GC'd a bit too much for our liking by the VM? (in which case a LRU queue, of fixed size, from classname->URL may keep the most relevant entries alive)  [reply] Comment 9 Andrew Clement 2006-08-23 10:51:03 EDT are we happy we have done enough on this for 1.5.3 ?

If I have a test class which subclasses some Test subclass (typically a decorator which could be in a jar or another source tree), and I select a source tree to run as Junit test that does not contan the superclass (w in that caseich typically has no tests to run anyway), that superclass will still be collected and part of the test run, always resulting in an annoying warning. In the attached project, in the pacakge explorer select the tst source tree, right clck and run as /Junit tests. See the junit view to understand the problem.

It looks much better now and I have and accepted all of the changes in the attached word doc. I made 2 small amendments (shown in the 280006 attachment). The most significant change I've made, which I'd like you to verify, is that I've added an explicit statement that in OpenUP/Basic, the PDM is part of the Design product. I also state that extensions to OpenUP may describe the data model more fully. We need to be clear somewhere about how the Data Model relates to the OpenUP product set - if not here then in the new Design the Database Schema step. Or maybe both?

I'm not so sure about embedding the name of the process, OpenUP/Basic, in guidelines like this.  Also, do we really need to say that someone might come along and rework this in a plug in?  Isn't that assumed? 2. I removed the second diagram.  Didn't seem to be adding anything other than describing notation that people don't seem to use. 3.

That's the version against what the Bugzilla issue was filed. Target Milestone is 1.0, which is the expected version of OpenUP/Basic when we will release the fix to the issue. Later, as iterations are planned, we assign the individual issues to 1.0 M1, 1.0 M2 and so on. For now, we are keeping bugs assigned to ""Content"" component, but it may be moved to ""OpenUP"" component (waiting response from Eclipse webmaster on how to create that component).  And sorry if these changes create an avalanche of emails :-)  Cheers,  Ricardo.  [reply] Comment 22 Mark Dickson 2007-01-23 07:22:26 EST This still seems to be assigned to me.

Cruz 2006-09-20 17:50:25 EDT I'm running into an issue with using Cascading Parameters in the BIRT-viewer.  The Cascading parameters works fine when i first load the report page.  But when i load another page then use the back button on the browser the Cascading Parameters will no longer work.  The Parameters box will appear but selecting the first parameter in the Cascading group will not populate the second parameter selection.  Canceling out the box and clicking on the parametrs icon will also not get the Cascading Parameters to work again. Only a refresh of the page will get the Cascading Parameters to function correctly.  This issue is most likely to occure if i user decides to generate a pdf of the report and then press the back button to enter in new parameters for another report.

Windows Application 3. Windows System  [reply] Comment 1 Hari H Krishna 2006-09-21 10:06:21 EDT As per discussion with Uliyana and Eric canging the severity to critical  [reply] Comment 2 Dave Smith 2006-09-21 17:50:57 EDT While there is a problem parsing some log files with a rules adapter that uses a timeFormat string to parse a timestamp that includes fractional seconds, it does not affect the Windows Event log adapters.  This is because the Windows Event logs do not include a fractional second value but the EventLogReader program that converts the binary event log into a text file pads the timestamp with a fractional second value of 6 zeros (eg. CreationTime: 10/24/2005 14:25:05.000000;).  The fractional seconds are only an issue if they are non-zero.  In the Windows Event log case I believe they will always be zero.  I have never encountered one where it was non zero.  Therefore, I will downgrade the severity to normal since the problem has never been encountered with Windows Event Logs.  However, I'll target this to 4.3 to fix the creationTime rule to truncate the fractional seconds to 3 digits in case the event logs change in the future to generate timestamps with longer fractional seconds. This downgrading has been negotiated with Eric Labadie who represents the consuming product who opened this bugzilla.

Additional exports may be added by using the ""extendedFrameworkExport"" ServletConfig init-param in web.xml.  Note: This bundle is only generated if not already present in the plugins directory.

We need a way to filter that. Two solutions: 1) an ldap filter in the xml, but this will limit the reusability of the bundle 2) getting the values from the config admin service  [reply] Comment 1 Simon Kaegi 2006-10-10 17:06:11 EDT As an initial step I like your first suggestion; adding an LDAP service registration filter to the xml. It's fairly straight-forward and handles the use-case although admittedly at a cost in terms of reusability. By default if no filter is specified all servlets, resources, and httpcontexts will continue to be associated with all services.  I'd like to track the runtime config approach in a separate bug as it's more involved and I'm less sure on the timing.  [reply] Comment 2 Jeff McAffer 2006-10-10 17:32:40 EDT I can't help but feel this is a bad direction.  It violates the producer/consumer separation and encourages ""bad"" behaviour.  Config admin is one way. Something akin to the capabilities mechanism where a third party describes the set of contributions that should be linked into a particular server is another (similar) approach.  My hesitation here is that we will introduce something that basically we will then tell people to not use.  [reply] Comment 3 Simon Kaegi 2006-10-10 18:09:37 EDT Alright. I'll buy that we should wait on this as there isn't really a pressing need at the moment as its quite rare to run more than one HttpService in a single VM.  I understand the producer/consumer concern and it's definitely legitimate. I'm relatively comfortable with a ""filter"" attribute however as I think that eventually we could use it at runtime. I'm hoping we can dynamically alter an extension and then receive and respond to a ""changed"" event. We don't have this capability currently so I'll accept that we shouldn't tie ourselves to the static approach. [Untargetting until we have a more concrete approach.]  [reply] Comment 4 Simon Kaegi 2006-10-25 21:49:37 EDT I think that the recent plugin ""customization"" worked talk about on the dev list is relevant to this bug report. ...offering to help test here.  [reply] Comment 5 Pascal Rapicault 2006-10-26 08:41:52 EDT I disagree. This mechanism should not be used as an excuse for sloppy design, or part of a solution for customizability. This xml processing mechanism should be used for backward compatibility issues and ""bad plugins"" in the context of a product. Therefore I would not expect the eclipse platform to ship with such files or recommend its usage.  Also there are no guarantee that this mechanism will make it into eclipse  [reply] Comment 6 Simon Kaegi 2007-03-16 17:57:35 EDT I agree that the customization should only be used to deal with problem situations.  The approach we're considering is to add a <serviceSelector/> element (to the servlets and resources extensions) that will have two modes of operation. The first takes an ldap ""filter"" as an attribute and uses it to filter which Http Service to register agains. The second approach uses a ""class"" attribute that will cause instantiation of a Filter class capable of arbitrary filtering -- one example being to create a filter from Config Admin.  To try and address re-usability we're adding the capability to define your extensions in a separate plugin from your resources.

While they could certainly write code to provision the server via Configuration Admin, it might also be useful to provide a web interface.  Of course this might open up a more general discussion of how to dynamically provision the server.  Restarting and/or rebuilding the WAR for such an administrative task is probably not desirable.

When using IE, if the user chooses an item in the first combo box and then generates the report without selecting an  value for the 2nd or 3rd parameter a javascript error occurs.  The error was caused by the following line in the collect_parameter : function( )  var temp = oSEC[0].options[oSEC[0].selectedIndex].text;  The problem is caused by oSEC[0].selectedIndex having a value of -1 which is an invalid index.  On Firefox, this selectedIndex value is zero when an item is not selected.  As a temporary fix, we have added the following code to insure the index is zero instead of -1.  if (oSEC[0].selectedIndex == -1) { oSEC[0].selectedIndex = 0; }  [reply] Comment 1 Jerry Cheng 2006-09-27 22:06:52 EDT Has fixed in 2.2.0.

2006-10-03 04:35:10 EDT,159144,Keeping an old builder configuration causes strange UI behaviour,"Keeping an old builder configuration causes strange UI behaviour [reply] Description Steve Young 2006-09-28 12:48:05 EDT If an old AspectJ project is opened, the user is presented with a dialog, informing them that the project's builder is out of date, that a new builder will be added to the project, and asking whether the user wants to keep the old builder as well.  This works, in that the two builder configs exist in the .project file.  However, on the Builder page of the project's properties page, both builders are listed with the same name, so the user has to guess which one is old and which new.  In addition, deselecting the newer builder is possible, but on application of this choice, the same dialog appears, and the new builder conifg is added to the project again (and selected).  There are now three builders defined in the .project file and thus the properties page.  If multiple builders are allowed to be maintained then:  1. they should be named/versioned in the properties page 2. it should not be possible to deselect the new builder (since it is clearly essential)  [reply] Comment 1 Matt Chapman 2006-10-02 10:33:48 EDT The option to keep the old builder was to aid transition to the new builder by allowing projects to be shared between versions of AJDT with each builders. But the last release with the old builder was AJDT 1.1.12 over two years ago, so this level of compatibility is no longer required. The easiest fix here is therefore to remove the option to keep the old builder. The transition to the new builder will now happen automatically without prompting the user.

However, elements are mapped to the same item more than once (each time it is updated via doUpdateItem(Widget widget, Object element, boolean fullMap)).  This results in many dispose listeners for each element to unmap it, which is a potential performance issue.  The debugger subclasses the tree viewer and updates (clears) filtered children when an element is unmapped. It ends up doing the operation many times (once for each dispose callback), instead of once.

But if a person from the community (e.g. someone who is accessing the repository via a pserver anonymous connection) loads our releng project and then tries to import the project set, it fails.  If you manually edit all the psf files and replace ""extssh"" with ""pserver"" it works.

As you can see it's similar to ""Add Resources"" dialog which appears when you want to commit some unknown new files to a repository.  I've already done a logic which is hidden in the dialog: checking for alternative, known repositories, extension point for the dialog. Just wanted to know your opinion before moving on, so I won't make  a bad turn.  [reply] Comment 4 Michael Valenta 2007-03-15 12:10:51 EDT I think a table isn't the best way to present this. How about a page that has a description a the top that includes the location from the project set. You could then have a list that showed the known repositories that match (i.e. same host and repo path). The user should have the option to create a new location and the new location page should be used and pre-populated with the information from the project set. In essence, this would be very similar to the first two pages of the checkout wizard.  [reply] Comment 5 Tomasz Zarna 2007-03-15 12:20:05 EDT I haven't pointed that out in my previous post, but I was thinking that an alternative repository propositions will be presented as a drop-down list. There would be also ""Create a new location"" entry on that list, we can even make it default.  If I'm still not making myself clear enough I can prepare another fake screen-shot in a second.  [reply] Comment 6 Tomasz Zarna 2007-03-15 12:22:33 EDT PS. Moreover, my dialog will work for multiple unknown repositories from a project set. It will prevent from opening the same dialog many times.  [reply] Comment 7 Michael Valenta 2007-03-15 13:17:40 EDT OK, I think I see what you are saying. If there are multiple repositories in the project set, you would want to have an entry for each one and be able to specify the repository to use for each. This prevents you from needing to prompt for each unique repository in the project set. And you would have a button that opened another dialog to create a new entry which would then be added to the list for any project set repository location that matched. I think that sounds reasonable.  [reply] Comment 8 Tomasz Zarna 2007-03-21 09:45:17 EDT Created attachment 61539 [details] First, rough version of the patch  Let me show what I've been up to for last 2 days (excluding Test Day of course). This is the very first version of the patch file, however after applying you should be able to see the dialog I was talking about. This could be a better way to start a discussion than sending faked screenshots.  To make the dialog show up you will need to import a project set which has different connection method that one from your Repositories list (host and repository path should be the same).  The dialog doesn't change the way project set importing takes place. There are just some system.outs to show a selection one have made after the dialog is closed.  Moreover, after yesterday's manual tests I bumped into another alternative repository selection dialog which already exist in Eclipse. I though I can combine these two and reuse that code. Screenshots will follow.  There is also Mylar's Context attached.

Selected repository is then displayed in the second column, next to the repository from a project set.  [reply] Comment 12 Michael Valenta 2007-03-21 10:07:56 EDT From the screen shots, the what you have looks good but we need to add the ability to create a new repository location as well. I tried the patch and my first task was to load a project set into a new workspace. In this scenario, I would still expect to be prompted to create an alternate repository location (i.e. I still may need to convert an extssh to a pserver or vica versa and it would also be helpful if I could provide a user name that would become a fixed part of the repository location.  On the technical side of things, I think we can get away with adding a method to the IUserAuthenticator interface for prompting which saves us from needing to define another extension point.  [reply] Comment 13 Tomasz Zarna 2007-03-23 08:45:25 EDT Created attachment 61808 [details] Advanced configuration of an alternative repository  Michael, I hope this screen shot is closer to your vision of the alternative repository configuration. Let me quickly describe it. First of all, the ""Import Project Set"" dialog from the screen shot will be displayed every time user imports a project sets. This can be changed by ticking a checkbox there. The second dialog pops up when user clicks [...] button. I belive that three radio buttons there are self-explanatory. Worth mentioning is the fact that fields from ""Configure new repository"" will be populated with values from ""CVS Repository from the change set"" or ""'Compatible' repository"" respectively. I was also thinking about adding a button to clear all these fields. Doesn't the new dialog look too complex to you?  [reply] Comment 14 Michael Valenta 2007-03-23 09:56:27 EDT That's a good starting point. Here's my comments:  1) I don't think we need the option to skip the dialog. Project Set imports happen infrequently enough that we can justify prompting for the repository information every time.  2) The use of the ... button is not really a standard Platform practice. Also, the location selection dialog is a bit busy. Instead, perhaps we could use a drop down list in the table to allow the user to select an existing repository location. If not matching locations exist, we can prime the field with the location from the project set.  3) To deal with repository location creation, we could add a Create Location button to the dialog that would launch the Create Location wizard. If an entry is selected when we launch the wizard, we could prime the fields with the values from the Project set. When the user has created the location, we could insert it into the location entry of the selected row.  4) Finally, I don't think we need the option to use the location from the project set. I think users only do this now because they have no option. Given the choice, they would rather use a location that has a fixed user name.  How does that sound?  [reply] Comment 15 Tomasz Zarna 2007-04-19 11:22:15 EDT Created attachment 64314 [details] Second (still rough) version of the patch  Instead of making another screen shot I've decided to create this patch. Although it still needs some polishing I belive it can be the answer for your suggestions Michael.  List of things that need to be done: * I would like to have a drop down list for a combo-box made of compatible CVS locations + rest (in that order) * To decide which repository locations are alternative I will take a method used in ""Change Sharing..."" dialog from a project's properties * As you suggested in comment 12 I will need to use IUserAuthenticator's extension point (instead of creating second one) * I've removed final modifier removed for LoadInfo.repositoryLocation... I was also thinking about creating a new copy of LoadInfo based on an existing one, and then replacing them. I'm not sure which solution is better, less invasive * I would like to add validation of the newly configured, alternative CVS repository (as in NewLocationWizard) * I will need to work on columns width in the table * When a user decide not to overwrite a project from a project set I will need to hide it's repository location from the table (don't need to ask for an alternative repository if we won't import the project)  Michael, if you could tell me if I'm on a good track...  [reply] Comment 16 Tomasz Zarna 2007-04-19 11:22:18 EDT Created attachment 64315 [details] mylar/context/zip  [reply] Comment 17 Michael Valenta 2007-04-19 16:30:48 EDT I think we are going in the right direction but I have a few comments:  1) It appears that only repository locations for which a matching location can be found are shown in the table. It is more likely that there are no repositories defined when the user imports so we need to handle that case. By default, you could file the right column with the location as it would appear if the user didn't change it. As a test for this, create a working set and then start Eclipse on a new workspace and import the working set. When I tried this I got the old prompt. If there are projects from multiple repositories in the project set and I have one of them defined, only the projects for the define repository are imported.  2) Perhaps we should use a TitleAreaDialog and add a description that explains to the user what is going on (i.e. the project set contains partial repository information and we need to get the rest of the information.  3) Canceling the dialog doesn't cancel the operation.  4) The table columns didn't take up all the available space but should.  5) I find the table rows very narrow. Can we add margins to the top and bottom of each row?  6) When creating the location, I had the validate checkbox checked but my location wasn't validated (i.e. I could enter an invalid repository).  [reply] Comment 18 Tomasz Zarna 2007-04-20 11:41:04 EDT Created attachment 64457 [details] Patch v3  Here it is. Michael, the patch is addressing all your last comments and my todos from comment 15.  [reply] Comment 19 Michael Valenta 2007-04-20 15:49:33 EDT Here are some comments:  1) For me, if extssh was in the project set, the New Location Wizard will say pserver. The repository and repository path are there but the connection method isn't.  2) It would be nice if the text on the New Location Wizard said Create instead of Finish.  3) You removed the code that made the repository known. The result of this is that, if the user supplies a password but doesn't save it, they will get prompted later in the operation for the password again.  The good news is that you are most of the way there. The bad news is that I think the change is a bit too big to make at this point. I would like to put it aside for now and we can revisit it at the beginning of 3.4. That will provide plenty of opportunity to get feedback from users.  [reply] Comment 20 Tomasz Zarna 2007-07-09 13:11:24 EDT Created attachment 73350 [details] Patch v4  Michael, if you could take a look at the patch once again. Here are my comments/questions to the fourth version of it:  1) Can team project set file contain any passwords? If yes, should I use them to prime the dialog when creating a new location? 2) In order to change the Finish button label to ""Create"" I made finishButton field protected (was private). See org.eclipse.jface.wizard.WizardDialog. I'm not sure if it's acceptable. 3) What do you think about the dialog's initial height? Don't you think it's to small? Should I implement storing/loading of the dialog's size? 4) I was also thinking about using ControlDecoration to indicate whether suggested alternative repository is an existing one, needs to be created or it's a perfect match. I've found two bugs related to the topic: bug 162497 and 162770. How to you find the idea? 5) The wizard and the dialog are missing context help.  I will be happy to hear your comments.  [reply] Comment 21 Michael Valenta 2007-07-10 12:45:11 EDT In general, I think the mapping works well but we still need some refinements to the patch.  First, here are my answers to your questions:  1) The project set doesn't contain passwords 2) We can't change API in JFace. I think you can do what you want by overriding the createButton method and looking for the FINISH id. 3) Yes, the dialog is initially too small. We should set the initial size a bit bigger and use the API from  Dialog to remember the users size settings (see Dialog#getDialogBoundsSettings) 4) I'm not sure if this would help. You may try it out if you like but I think it can wait until my points below are addressed. 5) Add the context constants and log a bug to provide the doc (although you can add the TOC entries now if you like)  Here are some comments about the patch:  A) I think the dialog needs to be explained well. It is not obvious from looking at the table what the purpose of the dialog is. I think users will be confused when they are first presented with the dialog. I think we either need to expand the description or add a label that says something like:  The project set only contains partial repository information. Please use the table below to associate each project set repository with a repository location or click OK to use the default locations.  It would also be good if we could convey somehow that, if the user clicks OK, the old behavior still occurs.  B) In keeping with point A, I think we could exclude the connection method from the left column but leave the default in the right column the same (i.e. show the connection method). The column titles could be ""Project set repository information"" and ""Repository Location"".  C) In the constructor of AlternativeRepositoryDialog, you make use of an inner class to convert a map to the entries for the table. I think a better approach is this: - make fAlternatives an instance variable of  AlternativeRepositoryTable - create the instance of AlternativeRepositoryTable in the AlternativeRepositoryDialog constructor. The AlternativeRepositoryTable would take a map and translate it to the internal representation. - add a createControl(Composite) to AlternativeRepositoryTable that you call from AlternativeRepositoryDialog#createDialogArea I think this results in better encapsulation.  D) Why does IUserAuthenticator#promptForAlternativeRepository return an Object. It should return a Map. Also, why does it take a Map as a parameter. Shouldn't it just take the list of repositories from the project set?  E) I don't like the use of ""Alternative"" everywhere. I understand why you used it but I would prefer a different prefix. For instance, in the CVSProjectSetCapability I think that the isAlternativeRepositoryNeeded method could be changed to isAdditionRepositoryInformationRequired and the promptForAlternativeRespository could be changed to promptForAdditionRepositoryInformation.  I think that's it for now.  [reply] Comment 22 Tomasz Zarna 2007-07-13 12:36:29 EDT Created attachment 73754 [details] Patch v5  Here is the fifth version of the patch. I'm pretty sure it's not a final one, but I hope I'm getting closer to a solution which will satisfy both of us :)  Once again, here are my concerns/things to-do: 1) I removed final modifier for CVSProjectSetCapa$LoadInfo.location in order to be able replace it after the Alternative Repo dialog is closed. Is this acceptable? I can create a copy (clone) of project load object before replacing repository location.  2) I subclassed ConfigurationWizardMainPage and change its validation method a little bit. Now, when user tries to create an existing location an error message shows up saying that he/she should close the dialog and select the entry with that location in the combo box. The other solution is to allow create that location, instead of displaying an error (silently handle an error). I could select the existing location after the dialog is closed without creating a new location.  3) Answering to the second part of bullet D - the map is created in isAlternativeRepositoryNeeded. The fact that it's not empty (it contains repository locations from a project set mapped to a list of suggested known locations) is one of the factors which decide to prompt for an additional information (ask user to select an alternative repository from a list). Otherwise (the map is empty) we do not display the Alternative Repository dialog. Do you think I should postpone the creation of the map and check whether the dialog needs to display other way?  4) I will complete and polish my javadocs.  5) I will log a separate bug to extend the doc.  6) I will log a separate bug to provide some tests.  [reply] Comment 23 Michael Valenta 2007-07-16 12:57:22 EDT I think we're getting closer but I'm finding it hard to keep track of what changes from patch to patch. To simplify things, I've released the patch to branch ""bug_159258"". That way we can incrementally improve things more easily. You should load the branch and provide patches from that. Here are my latest comments  - In regards to the use of a Map, it just seems odd to accept a map as a parameter and return one as well. However, I don;t view this as a big issue so I'll leave it to you to decide what to do. - I don't really like making instance variables directly accessible to subclasses. In the particular case of the NewLocationWizard, you should be able to get around it by creating a protected createMainPage method which you can override in the subclass. You can then call super.addPages() from the subclass add pages to avoid the duplication of the setting of the properties. - I still don't think that ""alternative"" is the proper term to use everywhere. How about the following renames: AlternativeRepositoryDialog -> ConfigureRepositoryLocationsDialog (or ConfigureProjectSetRepositoriesDialog) AlternativeRepositoryTable -> ConfigureReposiotryLocationsTable  P.S. I didn't include the doc project in the branch but I did include the other 3 plug-ins.  [reply] Comment 24 Tomasz Zarna 2007-07-24 08:57:44 EDT Created attachment 74451 [details] Patch v6  The patch is meant to be applied to the ""bug_159258"" branch. It addresses your previous comments only. The patch got so big because I renamed two classes.  [reply] Comment 25 Michael Valenta 2007-07-24 10:43:03 EDT I've released the latest patch to the branch (and fixed a compile error due to a change in a non-branched project). Szymon can you load the branch (bug_159258) and have a look at the new feature. The branch projects are org.eclipse.team.cvs.core, org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui and org.eclipse.team.tests.cvs.core.  [reply] Comment 26 Szymon Brandys 2007-07-26 14:30:57 EDT My first impression  1) the initial width is too big  2) we can add ""Show only compatible repository location"" checkbox like it is in Project Properties>CVS>Change sharing  3) Why do we use a dialog instead of a wizard page?  [reply] Comment 27 Szymon Brandys 2007-07-26 16:07:55 EDT Moreover there is a problem with the ""Create location"" button and the check box. During resizing of the dialog they disappear and we have a white space instead of the widgets. Michael saw it too. Tomek, can you observe similar behavior?  [reply] Comment 28 Tomasz Zarna 2007-07-27 10:14:20 EDT (In reply to comment #26)  > 1) the initial width is too big  No problem, I will adjust it.  > 2) we can add ""Show only compatible repository location"" checkbox like it > is in Project Properties>CVS>Change sharing  Personally, I am not convinced of your idea. But I've got a different proposition: I can add named separators between each group of repo locations in a combobox. Similar to ""--- Workspace matches ---"" in Open Resource dialog. E.g.  ------from project set---- :extssh@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse (default selection) ----------compatible------ :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse ---------others----------- :extssh:tzarna@9.158.141.245:/cvsroot/eclipse :pserver:dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse  > 3) Why do we use a dialog instead of a wizard page?  I was thinking about using a wizard here, but my idea was to create a wizard for all operations which need to be taken place during a Team Project Set file (i.e. select a file, confirm overwrite, configure repo locations and so on). What do you think about that? If you agree with me I think we should rather report separate bug for it.  (In reply to comment #27) > Moreover there is a problem with the ""Create location"" button and the check > box. During resizing of the dialog they disappear and we have a white space > instead of the widgets. Michael saw it too. Tomek, can you observe similar > behavior?  Yep, I saw it too, but I thought it's an SWT issue. Do you think it's my fault?   [reply] Comment 29 Tomasz Zarna 2007-07-30 09:05:42 EDT (In reply to comment #26)  Answering bullet 2): As you can see there are many approaches to make the dialog more intuitive. I'm not saying that I don't agree with, I just think maybe it will be better to open a separate bug for this issue. What do you think?  > 3) Why do we use a dialog instead of a wizard page? I've logged bug 198258 to address this.  (In reply to comment #27) > Moreover there is a problem with the ""Create location"" button and the check > box.

As I mentioned in comment 28 I did saw it too, but since my reply I haven't been able to reproduce it. I don't it can be a reason but just to make sure, what version are you using Szymon? I tried it on N20070714-0010, N20070723-0010 and N20070729-0010. It looks fine on all of them.

The title ""Determining problems in distributed applications"" covers content that is mostly about using the LTA. Recommendation is to change to the title in such a way that it indicates content is related to using the Log and Trace analyzer. This will help the user in several ways: - quickly get to the LTA help - stay assured that all LTA help is under one topic and there is no need to browse around to see if there is anything else under other topics.  This defect is normal and not major because the user can alternatively search on ""Log and Trace Analyzer"" if they know that's the help they are looking for. Still, I consider it important to fix.

""Prune empty directories"" is turned off.  Team -> Synchronize also fails to bring in the empty directory. This was a problem in Eclipse 3.1. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=117515  The only way I found to get empty directories from CVS is to check out the project and then use ""Replace with latest"" from branch.  [reply] Comment 1 Michael Valenta 2006-10-02 14:20:07 EDT In 3.2.1, I performed a checkout with pruning turned off and the empty directories were included. If this doesn't work for you, please provide the exact steps to reproduce (and please use 3.2.1 as it is the latest release).  [reply] Comment 2 Bruce 2006-10-02 15:10:07 EDT This does not work for me using Eclipse 3.2.1.  Start with a project in CVS containing at least one folder that has an empty sub-folder. i.e. myProject/xmlFolder/emptyFolder. The project should not be in your workspace. If it is in your workspace, delete your project and all contents.  Check out the project from CVS. The project exists in your workspace. The subfolders (xmlFolder) exist. But the empty folder (emptyFolder) does not exist.  Right click on the project or parent folder (xmlFolder) and replace the project or parent folder with latest from CVS. The empty folder will appear.  [reply] Comment 3 Michael Valenta 2006-10-02 15:36:51 EDT Here's what I did:  1) Turned off pruning (i.e. unchecked the Prune empty directories preference on the Files and Folders tab of the Team/CVS preference page.  2) Perform an Import and chose Projects from CVS  3) Selected an appropriate repository and project  4) Resulting project in my workspace had empty directories present at both the root and nested within other directories  These steps work for me in both 3.2.1 and 3.3 M2. Are you doing something different?  [reply] Comment 4 Bruce 2006-10-02 17:12:07 EDT Mike,  Thanks for trying to reproduce this.  Step 1 is the same.

[reply] Comment 9 Bruce 2006-10-03 17:46:41 EDT Mike,  Are you checking out projects from HEAD or from a branch? I found that checking out a project from HEAD does return empty directories. I am checking out a project from branch i0ptd92. The branch is the information returned in the third line.  I followed up with our CVS support team and reviewed the CVS documentation. I found that prune empty directories is the default when you checkout a project and specify a branch with the -r option. There appears to be no option to turn off pruning. http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/index.php?title=CVS--Concurrent_Versions_System_v1.12.12.1:_Guide_to_CVS_commands#SEC172  Can you confirm that you do not get empty directories when checking out a project from a branch?  This behavior is not documented in the CVS preference documentation for the prune empty directory option. Let me know if you want me to open a defect for the documentation.  [reply] Comment 10 Michael Valenta 2006-10-04 09:42:20 EDT It's all coming back to me now. That is exactly the case.

To support this goal, BIRT should provide capabilities that make it easy for the developer to deploy the BIRT Runtime and reports in their application using easy-to-use tools. This project explores the use of tools from the WTP project in order to accomplish this goal.

Now both editors show as dirty (so far so good). 5) Hit Ctrl+S in the compare editor.  The compare editor's dirty flag goes away, but the Java editor still appears dirty. 6) Activate the Java editor.  It says the file has changed externally.  Since they share the same buffer, saving one editor should clear the dirty state of both.

It appears to be related to the workbench Saveables support. Once that gets involved, a different path through the save logic occurs and we write the file direclty instead of saving through the document provider.  [reply] Comment 3 Michael Valenta 2006-10-03 12:07:30 EDT I also appears that, once a reload is forced in the regular editor, the regular editor and the compare editor end up using different buffers. This means that the compare editor needs to detect external changes and reobtain the buffer when that occurs.  [reply] Comment 4 Michael Valenta 2006-10-10 14:03:55 EDT The problem also occurs when an element in the Structure pane is selected.

[reply] Comment 7 Thomas Schindl 2006-10-03 18:26:35 EDT Well on the otherside is it really natural if we have relative coordinates to transform them to absolute ones and afterwards transform them back to relative ones, or did I read the whole thing in the wrong way:  1. TooltipSupport: MouseEvent => coordinates relative to Widget 2. TooltipSupport: Transform them to absolute coordinates on Display 3. TooltipSupport: TreeViewer#getItem(x,y) transform the coordinates back to relative ones.  I think the problematic implementation is the one TreeViewer#getItem() which wants to get absolute coordinates (Tod you are contradicting yourself there because at the moment we have an API for absolute coordinates :-).  TableViewer#getItem() needs to be fixed to behave like it does in TreeViewer but from my point of view getItem(x,y) implementation is very strange because I'd expect them to work just like Tree#getItem(Point) and Table#getItem(Point).  I'd deprecate getItem(x,y) (which might not be possible because it's part of StructuredViewer) and advertise the new API but if we decide against the new API we need to adjust the JavaDoc of ColumnViewer#getRowPart(Point) and we should force people to implement getItem(x,y) by declaring it abstract in ColumnViewer.  I'm not happy to add new API functions but the old getItem(int x, int y) doesn't really make sense but it's not really a problem if we/you decide against it.  [reply] Comment 8 Boris Bokowski 2006-10-03 21:03:09 EDT TableViewer.getItem(int,int) does not implement the spec in StructuredViewer and needs to be fixed to use display coordinates:  StructuredViewer.getItem(int,int) * Returns the item at the given display-relative coordinates, or * <code>null</code> if there is no item at that location.  You are correct that StructuredViewer.getItem is inconsistent with Table/Tree.getItem.  But after fixing TableViewer.getItem to implement the spec, I don't see the need to add new API, I can live with the redundant coordinate transformations.  For ColumnViewer#getRowPart(Point) we need to specify if it takes display coordinates or coordinates relative to the underlying control.

[reply] Comment 1 Simon Archer 2006-10-04 16:12:01 EDT Looking at the source it seems that org.eclipse.equinox.cm is built against the OSGi Foundation Execution Environment, rather than the OSGi Minimum Execution Environment.  This is truly unfortunate.  I took a quick look and I see the following classes are used, which are not available in the OSGi Minimum Execution Environment:  - DateFormat - HashMap - LinkedList - TreeMap - TreeSet  Also:  - The File method listFiles() is not defined.   In the past I've survived without DateFormat by using Calendar, but of course locale specific formatting is therefore not possible, or at least a lot harder.  This is clearly not a case where date/time formatting justifies using the large Execution Environment.  All uses of HashMap can be replaced with Hashtable.  If you've typed your declarations to the Map interface then this should be an easy fix.  Regarding LinkedList, TreeMap and TreeSet, I would suggest using some Collection available in the Minimum Execution Environment, or else implement your own.  Again, not really something that justifies the larger Execution Environment.  This might not be an exhustive list of issues.  [reply] Comment 2 Simon Archer 2006-10-04 19:07:35 EDT Wow, it seems that the ee.minimum.jar that I have been compiling against was dated 5/26/2005, and seems to be the OSGi Minimum 1.0.  Thanks to John W Ross for pointing out the error of my ways.  So, now that I'm using the ee.minimum.jar for OSGi Minimum 1.1 I can happily report that the only compilation error is due to the use of DateFormat.  As I mentioned before, working around this is possibly using Calendar.  As it turns out, bug 14982 discusses exactly this and Tom attached a patch he created to work around a similar problem:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=149892#c10  Thanks, and sorry for the fire drill.  [reply] Comment 3 Simon Archer 2006-10-04 19:22:50 EDT The ee.minimum.jar I was using had been copied from the Equinox project org.eclipse.osgi straight out of CVS, so maybe that one needs to be updated.

It seems fine and looks harmless as DateFormat is not central to the cm implemtation. Ruibin, does this patch work for you? (the patch sets the Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment, however I did not get a chance to try this in min 1.1 environment)  -- As an aside... One thing I'm less comfortable with is that this code will likely need to be repeated elsewhere.

I have been reluctant to move the core Equinox framework off of ee min 1.0.

The result is that you get both an ""adviceDidNotMatch"" warning as well as the ""advises"" marker.  I'm in two minds whether this is an aspectj or ajdt bug. As yet I have not been able to write an AJ testcase which demonstrates the problem. I'm leaning towards it being an AJDT bug because it's ajdt which places the ""advises"" marker against the advice in the project which is on the aspectpath.  [reply] Comment 1 Helen Beeken 2006-10-05 09:47:35 EDT Created attachment 51471 [details] testcase  To recreate this bug:  1. unzip the attachment into your workspace 2. build aj1 3. open aj1\pkg\A.aj - you should see an ""adviceDidNotMatch"" warning (which is correct since this project only knows about itself so thinks the advice doesn't match anywhere) 4. build aj2 5. aj1\pkg\A.aj now shows that it both advises the method call and that the advice did not apply.

Then when aj2 is built, it adds the advises relationship and removes the warning from aj1. If aj1 is rebuilt, the added relationship is removed, and the warning returns. I think this is the most appropriate behaviour, so that stale relationships are not left behind. In a setup like this I think it's more useful for aj2 to depend on aj1, so that if aj1 is rebuilt, then aj2 will be also.  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",mpchapman

How can I easily create CVS patches with Unix line endings without opening and manually converting each patch file in Eclipse or Notepad++?  I have Project line endings set to Unix in my Workspace -> New text file line delim prefs and even have tried unchecking Team > CVS > Files and folders > Convert text files to use platform line ending. I'm thinking the patch should just check whatever the Workspace prefs line endings are and use those.  [reply] Comment 1 Bogdan Gheorghe 2006-10-10 17:36:34 EDT We would be happy to accept a patch for this. The DiffOperation class is responsible for writing out the patch and it currently uses stream.println. This would need to be changed to take into account the current workspace line ending setting.  [reply] Comment 2 Krzysztof Daniel 2007-02-12 09:15:07 EST In the DiffOperation the stream is initialized by _abstract_ method openStream, so any changes will affect all subclasses of DiffOperation.  I would like to avoid subclassing PrintStream and changing its behavior, although it seems to be the fastest way, and I would like to avoid major changes in those classes, too.  So, maybe it is good idea to request changes from Sun (customizable line endings)?  [reply] Comment 3 Michael Valenta 2007-02-13 09:15:28 EST I guess you could ask them but that is not really a solution to the problem. It wouldn't be difficult to write the bytes directly to an OutputStream using the same line endings from the original file in the patch.  [reply] Comment 4 Krzysztof Daniel 2007-02-14 04:33:16 EST Migrating to OutputStream will not be difficult, however it may slightly change current API.  But from where line ending style should be retrieved? Workspace? Project?  Maybe it is good to add new section on advanced tab of create patch wizard, which should have 3 radios: 1. win 2. *nix 3. macos  The section should be active only if patch will be created to file, and initial selection would be:  patch into filesystem: system line ending patch into workspace: workspace/project line ending.  I do not see any reason to take care about clipboard line ending.  While approaching the problem this way we can avoid any manipulation of API, just in a method org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FileDiffOperation.copyFile() invoke file ending conversion.  On the sun pages there was similar request, however all are 'WONTFIX'.  [reply] Comment 5 Michael Valenta 2007-02-14 08:21:04 EST I think it would be easiest if the line endings in the patch matched the line endings in the file from which the patch was generated.  [reply] Comment 6 Krzysztof Daniel 2007-02-14 08:27:51 EST but please imagine many projects in the workspace with different encodings.

However, I think you should not be testing for ""ready"" before returning the value. What ready says is that there are buffered contents available in the underlying reader so the read will not block. However, it doesn't say that there aren't more characters coming. Under certain circumstances, I believe the code in the patch could return a single line as two separate lines.

The problem is that there may be patches for several files in the patch. I think that the patch file should have a single line ending for the whole file and not a different one for each file (which your patch could end up with). I wasn't considering the whole problem in comment 5 and I apologize for that. I think it would be reasonable to consult the CVSProviderPlugin.getPlugin().isUsePlatformLineend() to determine if the platform line ending should be used or if just '\n' should be used. This line ending would need to be used for both new files and existing files. The best approach would be to change the stream that is returned from DiffOperation#getOutputStream so that it used the proper line ending.  Again, I apologize for leading you in the wrong direction.

[reply] Comment 15 Michael Valenta 2007-02-21 10:23:27 EST The latest patch is looking better. I do have a couple of questions though:  1) Is there a reason you overrode the print() methods? I would have though that overriding the println methods would be enough.  2) Do we need the platformSettings instance variable. It only appears to be used in the constructor?  [reply] Comment 16 Krzysztof Daniel 2007-02-21 10:40:51 EST 2. You are right, we do not need it.  1. Methods print should be overridden, but I think not all. Calling print('\n') causes the new line character being converted to platform new line (PrintStream specification). You can assume, that overriding only the println should be enough (logic suggests, that it should be used internally by PrintStream), however I would not rely on that. Anyway, there is a couple of methods I can remove (almost all with primitives attributes).  [reply] Comment 17 Michael Valenta 2007-02-21 10:54:48 EST Since we are the client, I think it is safe to assume that print is never called with a string that contains a new line character. Also, you are correct in that we cannot assume that the println(arg) methods call the println method. Hence, we should only need to override all the println methods. However, we could override the println methods to call print(arg) and then println() and println() could use print(lineDelimeter) to print the line ending. This way, we wouldn't need to implement the error handling (although it is not a big deal to do so).  [reply] Comment 18 Krzysztof Daniel 2007-02-21 11:17:18 EST Created attachment 59485 [details] Only println methods modified  I cannot use print(newLineCharacter), because the character will be translated according to platform.

2006-10-23 08:07:31 EDT,160236,Cross Reference view does not show binary aspects,"Cross Reference view does not show binary aspects [reply] Description Eugene Kuleshov 2006-10-09 14:23:19 EDT I am using Eclipse 3.2 and the latest AJDT 1.4.1 dev build from the update site and it does not show binary aspects in the Cross Reference view even so they are woven into the bytecode.  These binary aspects came from Spring 2.0 and packaged in spring-aspects-2.0.jar, which I added into AspectJ Build / Aspect Path.  Spring advices are declared like this:  ---- private pointcut executionOfAnyPublicMethodInAtTransactionalType() : execution(public * ((@Transactional *)+).*(..)) && @this(Transactional);  private pointcut executionOfTransactionalNonPrivateMethod() : execution(!private * *(..)) && @annotation(Transactional);  protected pointcut transactionalMethodExecution(Object txObject) : (executionOfAnyPublicMethodInAtTransactionalType() || executionOfTransactionalNonPrivateMethod() ) && this(txObject); ---- protected pointcut beanCreation(Object beanInstance) : initialization((@Configurable *).new(..)) && this(beanInstance); ----  My test class look like this:  @Configurable public class Sample {  public Sample() { }  @Transactional public void main(String[] args) { System.err.println(""Sample""); }  }  ---  The Cross References view shows the following for the above class:  Sample +-- main(String[]) +-- advised by +-- {...} binary aspect: AnnotationTransactionAspect.class  As you can see it does not expand @Transactional aspect and does not show @Configurable aspect at all.  PS: Strange that @Transactional does not match on static methods, but it is a separate story...  [reply] Comment 1 Matt Chapman 2006-10-10 06:12:02 EDT Ah, the binary weaving support recently added to 1.4.1 dev builds only applies when the source code for the binary aspect is available in the workspace. Here, if you're just adding the spring aspects jar to the Aspect Path, there is no source, and AJDT is behaving as (currently) expected.  I see an ""advised by binary aspect"" marker in the editor, and a similar entry in the Cross References view.  So maybe this becomes an enhancement request. But what exactly do you expect it show when there is no source code for the aspect? We could look at making the binary aspect entry in the Cross References view a link to open the class in the class file editor (and support source attachments).  [reply] Comment 2 Eugene Kuleshov 2006-10-10 09:15:23 EDT That does not explain why advice on constructor is not shown at all.  BTW, I do have source for that jar in the workspace, but of course it is not attached/linked to spring-aspects.jar. You should allow to link th sources with aspect jars.  [reply] Comment 3 Matt Chapman 2006-10-10 09:33:59 EDT Good point. Let's make this bug for the missing advice marker on the constructor. Please raise an enhancement request for linking to attached source - we're aware of the need for this, but I don't think it's currently logged in bugzilla.  [reply] Comment 4 Eugene Kuleshov 2006-10-10 18:08:07 EDT Created two issues:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=160390 Allow to attach source to jars in inpath and aspectpath  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=160393 More open AJDT project configuration  [reply] Comment 5 Eugene Kuleshov 2006-10-10 18:26:04 EDT It is weird, but if I add default constructor, to the class with @Configurable it sometimes does show advice, but does not show the class for that advice:  ConfigurableBean +-- ConfigurableBean() |     +-- advised by |           +-- {...} binary aspect:    <--- no class name here +-- setProperty1(String) +-- advised by +-- {...} binary aspect: AnnotationTransactionAspect.class  I wonder if it is anyhow related to how advice is declared in these binary aspects. Spring is actually using abstract aspects that declare abstract pointcuts and concrete pointcuts declared in the concrete subclasses for these aspects.  [reply] Comment 6 Matt Chapman 2006-10-11 09:04:25 EDT Can you provide a testcase for the ""binary aspect with no name"" problem described above?  I can get AJDT to add the marker and cross reference entry for the advised constructor, but the information given to AJDT from AspectJ is incorrect - we're told that the constructor is advised by a pointcut! Therefore this bug can't be fixed until the AspectJ bug I've just raised for this has been fixed.  [reply] Comment 7 Eugene Kuleshov 2006-10-11 09:13:31 EDT It is pretty much the same as Sample class I showed before. For some reason advice for @Configurable is not being shown all the time. I still can't figure out why. Sometimes it is shown with no info about aspect (perhaps due to the issue you just found), but most of the time, even after rebuild it is not shown at all. No errors in Eclipse log either.  [reply] Comment 8 Matt Chapman 2006-10-23 08:07:31 EDT Fixed in:  1.4.1.200610230709 for Eclipse 3.2 (build.220) 1.5.0.200610230745 for Eclipse 3.3M2 (build.58)  AspectJ is now giving the correct information, and it is more detailed, so typically the links are now: advised by: ""before"" in binary aspect AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect.aj  instead of: advised by: binary aspect: AbstractBeanConfigurerAspect.class  I couldn't reproduce the ""aspect with no name"" issue, so please open a new bug if that still occurs now.

Raising the severity to critical because it will impact log imports if the harcoded directory does not exist.  [reply] Comment 2 Dave Smith 2006-10-10 17:10:47 EDT Upon further review of the code and testing with the latest TPTP 4.3 build (200610090100) I have concluded that there is no problem using the adapter files included with TPTP for the local and remote import scenario.  However, to make it easier to consume these adapter files for other purposes such as in standalone mode to write the events to a file by enabling the CBEFileOutputter component, we can change the directory value in the CBEFileOutputter properties to a ""."" so the user can take the default settings.  This is not a high severiy issue that needs to be fixed in 4.3 so I will drop the severity to normal and will target it to 4.4.  I'll add information about this issue in the GLA Programming document on the TPTP web site as part of bugzilla 152753 in 4.3.

Here's a start: That is doable with the configurablePackage extension.  Look at the classes within the org.eclipse.stp.soas.deploy.core.ui.configuration package.  The documentation is sparse, to say the least, so here's a quick explanation.  These are used to contribute property pages for editing a package's configuration.  The mechanism used is very similar to the basic property page and preference page dialog within Eclipse, with the exception that you need to provide the ""nodes"" for the pages.  A ""node"" is represented in the tree on the left-hand side of the dialog and is associated with a ""page"" displayed on the right.  You should use ConfigurationNode as the base class for your nodes.  You should use ConfigurationPage as the base class for your page implementations.  The main difference are the IConfigurationNode.save() and needsSave() methods.  These can be used for udpating the state of the configuration.  The impetus for thes methods, as opposed to using the default behavior in the PreferenceDialog, was to prevent save() from being called on nodes whose state may have already been saved by a parent or child node.  For the most part, you should be able to simply use performOk() on your page for updating the configuration.  Here's  a little example of an implementation for IConfigurationPageFactory.contribute():  pm.addToRoot(new MyConfigurationNode()); pm.addTo(""myConfigurationNodeId"", MyConfigurationChildNode());  [reply] Comment 1 Johnson Ma 2007-12-11 04:15:19 EST add the doc to wiki page below http://wiki.eclipse.org/Configuration_Ext_Explained  [reply] Comment 2 Denny 2007-12-11 04:17:06 EST It's fixed by Johnson  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",fugang.xu@iona.com

What happens: I synchronize, it shows some outgoing changes, I double-click the file on synchronize view.  It opens the compare editor, but in remote pane, it compares against a wrong revision (it appears to be always the revision on HEAD), instead of the current revision.  Apparently the other operations (commit, etc...) work fine, it appears to be only a ""wrong revision on compare"" problem.  Some characteristics from my environment that I hope can help to track this issue:  - My server is a CVSNT 2.5.01. - There are a lot of projects on repository (>50). - There are many branches created. - There are some branch of branch created.

I'm inside a branch, where revision 1.3 is the latest (with modifications).  I synchronized, and after double-clicking it, it attempts to compare with revision 1.9 (the latest of HEAD) and shows that message.

[reply] Comment 12 Willian Mitsuda 2006-12-13 12:47:03 EST Michael, this is happening in many machines here, with different projects/branches.  I'm willing to help you with this, since this is preventing us to use the compare feature we use extensively.  Can you point me where in the source code this bug can be? Then I can try to reproduce in a debug session.  [reply] Comment 13 Michael Valenta 2006-12-13 15:18:20 EST In regards to the failure to cache, it is odd given that we explicitly fetch the contents beforehand. It sounds like the cache has a bug where it says it has the contents cached before the compare editor opens and then somehow looses the contents when the compare editor is shown. I suspect the problem is related to the timeout we have for cached contents (i.e. perhaps we don't purge the cache properly and thus leave it in a bad state that gets cleared the first time you open the compare editor). This seems to be a separate issue that is less important the original issue (i.e. it is clear that something is wrong and reopening the editor fixes the problem). Could you open a separate bug report for this?  In regards to the original issue, there are a couple avenues to explore here:  1) You could trace the client/server communication involved with the Synchronization to see what is passed. Here's a link on how to do that:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/CVS_FAQ#Is_there_any_equivalent_to_CVS_CLIENT_LOG_is_Eclipse.3F  2) I noticed in the screenshot that you were using change sets. Does the problem happen when using a different model (e.g. Workspace or Java)?  3) Does the problem occur with the old Sync? I suspect it doesn't but it is good to confirm. See the following link for a description of what I mean by ""Old Sync"".  http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/CVS_FAQ#Synchronizing_has_some_regressions_in_Eclipse_3.2._Why.3F  4) As for source code, I would need to know the answer to question 2 and 3 before I can pinpoint a good location to debug the problem.

In my machine I'm using change sets with Mylar, but there are other machines using just the default team/CVS configuration, because they use Eclipse only as a CVS client for other IDEs.  > 3) Does the problem occur with the old Sync?

Here's a link on how to do that:  Good news, tracing the communication, I see that when model-based synchronization is on, there is a explicit get to the HEAD revision when double-clicking the file to open the compare editor:  CMD> cvs update -r ""1.9"" -C -d -P ""<file-name>""  With the model-based off, it get the right revision.

[reply] Comment 20 Michael Valenta 2007-01-15 11:33:06 EST Unfortunately, I am still not able to reproduce this. I assume that the fact that there is a workaround makes this less critical. However, if someone who is experiencing this wanted to debug it, the first place to look would be in the ResourceSaveableComparison$ResourceDiffCompareInput#getRightContributor (in the 3.2 codebase). This is the code that determines what revision is used for the right side of the comparison. In 3.3, ResourceDiffCompareInput is root level class (i.e. not internal to ResourceSaveableComparison).  [reply] Comment 21 Willian Mitsuda 2007-02-26 13:27:39 EST Update: I'm debugging now, and it is getting to line 107: ""diff = (IResourceDiff)twd.getLocalChange();"".  Examining ""diff.getBeforeState()"" returns a CVSResourceVariantFileRevision, whose variant.syncBytes field contains a ""1.9"" string encoded, which corresponds to the HEAD revision.  So I'm assuming the bug occurs before this method and I'll go up. Let me know if there are other interesting places to see.  [reply] Comment 22 Willian Mitsuda 2007-02-26 14:54:41 EST I tracked changes on difftree and apparently the only thing that is changing across compare openings is the syncBytes value from RemoteFile.  I tracked the changes to this field and I found a suspicious code at line 403:  // Make sure the sync bytes match the content that is being accessed syncBytes = newSyncBytes;  I found on case where the actual contents of syncBytes with revision 1.3.2.1 from branch is being replaced with another array from cache, with the value ""1.9"" on revision.  [reply] Comment 23 Michael Valenta 2007-02-26 16:13:11 EST The real question is where are the wrong sync bytes coming from? Here is a link to instructions on getting a client/server communications trace:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/CVS_FAQ#Is_there_any_equivalent_to_CVS_CLIENT_LOG_is_Eclipse.3F  It should reveal exactly what Eclipse is sending to the server and what the server is sending back. This may help determine where the 1.9 is coming from.  [reply] Comment 24 Willian Mitsuda 2007-02-26 17:22:55 EST It appears to be coming from the server, on what looks like to be the lastest command executed after synchronization.  Following is the snippet of the latest part of traffic, where I substituted the problematic file name by ""xxxx.cpp"", and the cvs path by ""/repository/myproject"".

Commit and tag with R1_0_0. - Modify this class. Commit and tag with R2_0_0. - Replace with version R1_0_0. Create a branch from this version, and start working on branch. - Make some modification on the class. Commit. This will create revision 1.1.2.1. - Make some modification. Synchronize. - The class will appear on synchronize view. Double-click to open compare. - It will compare against revision 1.2 (HEAD) instead of 1.1.2.1.

I just tested with a 2.5.03 installation and it works perfectly.

The old Synchronization will stay in the view unless it is > specifically removed (there's a remove in the view menu). Is this what you > mean? >  I'm talking about the workaround, which is to disable the model-based synchronization.  I was testing this bug with new model synchronization and I wanted to revert it to the old behavior.  So, I unchecked the box ""Allow models to participate on synchronizations"" on CVS synchronization preferences, accessing it through the ""Synchronization"" view menu.  I dropped the synchronization (the ""X"" on view menu), and synchronized again. But it was not enough, because the compare editor on the new synchronization contents still presented the bug (although the model-based sync is disabled because the model drop-down does not appears on view toolbar).  Perhaps something to do with the cache...  On this case I have to restart Eclipse for the synchronization to work.  [reply] Comment 31 Michael Valenta 2007-02-27 15:45:43 EST So what you are saying is that you did revert to the old behavior but the ""bug"" didn't go away until you restarted Eclipse. The underlying data for the two sync types is the same so what you say is possible. However, the data is persisted across restarts as well so I'm not sure why a restart would make a difference. I'm not sure if it is worth pursuing that at this time. I am more interested in the original problem. Are you saying that the problem does not occur in the latest CVSNT build?

[reply] Comment 34 Willian Mitsuda 2007-03-12 15:22:35 EDT Michael, I understand that it is not worth to make ""workarounds"" on Eclipse side just because of CVSNT faults, so I think the recommendation on this page:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/CVS_FAQ#What_server_versions_of_CVS_are_supported_by_Eclipse.3F  is not entirely true anymore.  I'd like to know what version is officially ""supported"", and by ""supported"" I mean: the version used on your tests. 2.5.03?  [reply] Comment 35 Michael Valenta 2007-03-12 15:39:04 EDT We do not test against CVSNT at all. CVSNT was promoted to supported because the main CVSNT developer made an effort to address several incompatibilities between CVS and CVSNT. Since we do not use CVSNT ourselves, we rely on the community to ensure that compatibility is maintained.  I will update the support version number for CVSNT on the FAQ (although you could do it yourself if you like since anyone who can comment in bugzilla can update the FAQ).

2006-12-19 11:22:10 EST,167716,Improve transaction management associated with ViewReportTablesUpdater,"Improve transaction management associated with ViewReportTablesUpdater [reply] Description Khan Tasinga 2006-12-12 14:29:16 EST Methods contained in the ViewReportTablesUpdater class obtain DB connections to perform their work. However, in certain situations, the work those methods perform should actually be part of larger transactions. Example? CIMOM removal (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=167175).  The methods that obtain DB connections should be overloaded, such that there is a version that accepts a connection being used in a larger transaction. For example, the deleteDependentViews() method looks something like this:  public void deleteDependentViews( String entityClass, String entityKey) { DBConnection connection = null; try { DBConnPoolDataSource ds = DBConnPoolDataSource.getInstance(); connection = (DBConnection) ds.getPooledConnection();  // Use connection to do work ... } finally { try { if (connection != null) connection.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }  To support more effective use of transactions, it can broken down into two methods that look like this:  public void deleteDependentViews(String entityClass, String entityKey) { DBConnection connection = null; try { DBConnPoolDataSource ds = DBConnPoolDataSource.getInstance(); connection = (DBConnection) ds.getPooledConnection(); deleteDependencyViews(connection, entityClass, entityKey); } finally { try { if (connection != null) connection.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }  public void deleteDependentViews( DBConnection connection, String entityClass, String entityKey) { // Use connection to do work ... }  Code leveraging ViewReportTablesUpdater should be updated for more effective use of transactions. Changes will likely span several classes, as Connection objects will need to be passed around to make their way to ViewReportTablesUpdater.  The transaction isolation solution to bug #167175 should be revisited. It should be backed-out in favor of better transaction management.  [reply] Comment 1 Rodica Ciurea 2006-12-18 09:25:04 EST After investigating the implementation of the methods contained in the ViewReportTablesUpdater class, I noted that they call the handleUpdate method, which performs inside a commit or rollback operation.  Probably the intention was to perform these methods using a separate transaction. In this case it is possible to implement the second solution described at bug 167175 and perform a commit operation before calling the ChangeDetection.complete method.  [reply] Comment 2 Rodica Ciurea 2006-12-19 11:22:10 EST The fix was implented by performing a commit operation before calling the ChangeDetection.complete method and was checked in Eclipse CVS on 12/18/2006.

Prasenjit, you're the person behind ViewReportTablesUpdater, correct? If so, would it be possible for you to verify whether or not the assumption Rodica made is correct? Though I probably need to go back and take a more detailed look at the code, off top, my sense is that if we use two separate transactions to resolve the issue described in bug 167175, we still leave the door open to database inconsistency. Before we close out this bug, I'd like to verify that we've taken the right approach.   Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",rodica_ciurea@ro.ibm.com

I will get into the development of the plug-in once the initial version of the ADT plug in is in place.  Feedback definitely welcome.  I'm still fuzzy on the process of getting the plug-in through the Eclipse IP review efforts.  [reply] Comment 2 Per Kroll 2007-01-02 12:57:12 EST Scott, this looks fine, but you may want to consider whether to do the donation earlier. So, you have 2 options: 1) Keep plan as is, and close the bug. 2) Update plan to reflect a donation of your initial draft plug-in. This would mean that you fill in questionnaire for contribution when you have the draft plug-in (Feb 28), and then continue working on the plug-in. Expect the approval to take ~2-4 weeks. Meanwhile, continue working, and once approved by IP legal, you finish up the plug-in within the EPF project. The advantage of this approach is that it allows others to work with you on finishing up the plug-in within the EPF project, rather than you being forced to do everything outside the project. Once plan is updated, close this bug, since the bug is completed no matter if you go with 1 or 2.   [reply] Comment 3 Scott Ambler 2007-01-05 13:53:03 EST The plan is an attachment to this bug.  Always happy to get feedback.  [reply] Comment 4 Brian G. Lyons 2007-01-10 11:16:09 EST The plan has been created.  Closing.  I'd be interested in seeing the next version of the plan more clearly aligned with the OpenUP project plan (just adding a column with the project iteration like ""E2"" called out).  But this is fine for now.  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",swa@ambysoft.com

New a jsp file based on birt template. 2. Input content as : <birt:requester id=""param_request_1"" name=""request1"" isCustom=""true"" reportDesign=""requester2_dt.rptdesign"" locale=""fr_fr""> p1_datetime: <input type=""text"" name=""p1_datetime""/> <input type=""submit"" name=""OK"" value=""submit""/> </birt:requester> 3. Preview the jsp file. 4. Input nothing and click ""submit"" button.  Expected result: Error from birt about blank datetime value.  Actual result: JS errors: Can't move focus to the control because it is invisible...  Error log:N/A  [reply] Comment 1 Jerry Cheng 2007-01-10 01:48:05 EST It is an issue about check if missing parameter. For this case, it should pop up the parameter dialog.

The Editor tab looks active, but the focus stays where it was before.

[reply] Comment 5 Javier Pedemonte 2007-01-24 14:29:11 EST Created attachment 57465 [details] patch v2  Different approach:  Change the inheritance order.  I changed all of the platform specific classes (the old MozillaBrowser) to be MozillaBrowserPlatform.  This class now extends Composite and doesn't reference any of the cross-platform code in 'src' directory.  Then, AbstractMozillaBrowser has now become the non-abstract MozillaBrowser class.  This extends MozillaBrowserPlatform, such that the new inheritance tree looks like this: Composite -> MozillaBrowserPlatform -> MozillaBrowser.  No more circular dependency.

[reply] Comment 3 Matt Carter 2007-07-24 06:37:40 EDT I implemented this separately, code looks almost identical, except shouldn't you be using a ModifyListener to trigger change events, rather than selection listener, technically?  Referring to the Events/Listeners section at the bottom of this page: http://www.eclipse.org/nebula/widgets/cdatetime/cdatetime.php?page=api  I am guessing you will get additional listener invocations every time the selection changes whether or not there is a change.  [reply] Comment 4 Peter Centgraf 2007-07-24 21:01:23 EDT Modify listeners are directly attached to the underlying Text widget, so they don't work if there is no Text component -- when the CDT.SIMPLE style is used.  The selection event is fired whenever the underlying Date value is changed, which is what I think we want.  This isn't the same as when the text selection changes in the Text widget.  As far as I know, there is no event to track that kind of selection.  [reply] Comment 5 Peter Centgraf 2007-07-31 15:24:36 EDT Fixed in HEAD.  Note that the new class CDateTimeObservableValue requires that the ""org.eclipse.core.databinding"", ""org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans"", and ""org.eclipse.jface.databinding"" optional dependencies must be resolved.  [reply] Comment 6 Hannes Erven 2010-01-18 18:42:44 EST (Sorry if this should've been created as a new issue - I felt its minor enough to just piggyback here, and Bug#279782 is also under way...)   The current implementation (CVS 1.1) does not handle updating with null values that should clear the control's content. This is due to null not being an ""instanceof Date"".  I'd suggest to apply this small change in doSetValue():  @Override protected void doSetValue(Object value) { -		if(value instanceof Date && !this.dateTime.isDisposed()) { +		if((value == null || value instanceof Date) && !this.dateTime.isDisposed()) { Date oldValue; Date newValue; try {   That way, setting null works.

I have add quick fixes support but only for two rpmlint warnings, setup-no-quiet and patch-not-applied but we can easily add more quick fixes in the future.

But many times the WSDL document is not located on the users file system, but on the internet (HTTP). This creates unnecessary steps, as well as additional opportunities for error. This feature request is for the addition of HTTP support for opening a WSDL document, which is then used to create the client library.  For example, the Eclipse STP user should be able to enter a URL such as http://ws.strikeiron.com/DnBQuickCheck2?WSDL  (see http://www.strikeiron.com/ProductDetail.aspx?p=343) into the SOA discovery mechanism, which would then use HTTP to download the WSDL document and generate the local client libraries for that web service.

(Preferences -> Java -> Code Style) It would be awesome if this was also available for PHP.  Related article: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-clean/index.html  Maybe contact the authors of that article / the Java code style feature to see how much refactoring is needed to get this to work with PHP too. Maybe make it PHP 5 only since PHP 5 is closer to Java.  My main problem with PDT's code formatter is that it doesn't support more flexible rules for indention. My requirements: - Displayed tab length = 8 spaces - Indent by 4 spaces - Replace all leading whitespace with tabs (= Smart tabs) (e.g. 8 spaces indention should be replaced by / set to 1 tab, 12 spaces should be replaced by 1 tab + 4 spaces)  PDT makes this pretty much impossible and it's a lot of manual work for me. Java under Eclipse 3.3 makes this super easy with the Code Style settings.  [reply] Comment 1 Christian Weiske 2007-10-22 03:53:24 EDT You could also include support to call PHP_CodeSniffer if installed (http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer ). Some predefined rules for Zend and PEAR would be great.  [reply] Comment 2 Sean Quinn 2009-09-10 21:06:39 EDT Has there been any further considerations by the PDT team to support more code formatting/styling options? This enhancement request has been open for quite some time now. Would love to see this feature included for PHP development, Zend Studio handles code formatting maybe Zend would be willing to contribute their formatting over to the PDT project to support interoperability?  [reply] Comment 3 Sean Quinn 2009-10-06 23:08:15 EDT Its been almost a month since the last comment was made (by myself). Not to be a bother, but for PDT to be a mature toolkit for PHP developers we really should have more advanced options for Code Styling/Code Formatting similar to those the the Java development tools have.  I'd be willing to bang around with the Plug-in development and try my hand at this and provide a proposed patch, but I have almost no time. Maybe if it doesn't look like any movement by the PDT team will occur on this front quickly I'll be able to give it a shot.  It would be nice if we could get a comment from the PDT team or some one associated with it that reflects whether this is actively being considered and when we might see it.

I filed a bug report with Mantis xDebug and they came to the conclusion that it is an Eclipse bug/issue.  Here is the bug report URL with the conclusion.  http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=1007   I have attached the same CODE that I supplied to Mantis to this bug report  Steps to reproduce.....  I am calling a static class that I am initializing a static variable with a const then returning that variable to the caller.  Then end result is fine, it works.  The issue is, when I go into debug mode, initializing the variable is not happening. The values cannot be seen.  This caused a great deal of time troubleshooting an issue that a variable was not being initialized when it really was.  Run the CODE.....  Place a break point on the line ""return self::$hello;"" and check the values of the line ""self::$hello = self::HELLO;""  You will see ""self::$hello"" is not initialized to a value, but letting the program run the expected result is obtained.

2009-03-05 15:31:45 EST,213328,AccProbe: Caret tracking,"AccProbe: Caret tracking [reply] Description Mike 2007-12-18 11:36:55 EST Caret events should be monitored either by: 1. registering a listener for MSAA's EVENT_LOCATIONCHANGED 2. registering listener for IA2_EVENT_TEXT_CARET_MOVED events Either listener should update the Explorer View with the object containing the caret, which will probably only need to be done once. The Properties View can then be updated to reflect properties of either the caret itself or the text under the caret (if any). The latter can be found by querying (and, if appropriate, revealing in the properties view) the IAccessibleText object. Additional properties may need to be added to the view for caret position when either event type is fired.  From Aaron Leventhal: There should be options of what to show for caret move events, maybe something like: [ ] Show offset Show text at caret: ( ) Character ( ) Word ( ) Line [ ] Show attribute range at caret offset Those are just ideas.  Also, it should try the new TEXT_OFFSET_CARET (-2) when getting the text, at least for Firefox. If it isn't supported (perhaps test to see if it works), it should feed in the real offset. Basically, by passing in -2 for the offset when getting text at the current line, you can make sure to get the right line (the logical offset when a caret is past the end of a line vs. at the beginning of the next line is the same).  [reply] Comment 1 Mike 2008-02-18 10:19:25 EST Can we do the suggested attachment of text attribute reporting as requested by Aaron?  > It would be good enough if it (text attribute-reporting) was just attached to > caret tracking. We could arrow through text with the caret and see not just > the caret position but the current attribute range start and attribute > name/value pairs.  We would simply continually feed the caret offset to the getAttributes method and add an 'attributes' property to the IAccessibleText properties list. This would need to be done manually since the describe method only reports on no-arg getters. However, other methods in the BeanUtils package provide for accessing based on other parameters.  [reply] Comment 2 Kavitha Teegala 2008-09-10 10:24:40 EDT This bug was created when the user was not able to call the parameterized methods. User can now view all the required IAccessibleText properties by inputing the correct parameters.  [reply] Comment 3 Kavitha Teegala 2008-11-03 13:46:40 EST Aaron, Mike mentioned you would like more features to Caret tracking. Please update this bug with the details of any additional features you would like to have. Caret tracking works in global mode and app-by-app mode for firefox3, but only in global mode for other Ia2 applications like symphony. All the IccessibleText properties are now displayed and user also has the option to provide input and call the parameterized methods.  [reply] Comment 4 Kavitha Teegala 2009-01-19 13:32:04 EST Aaron's requirements:  1. Removal of ""EVENT_SYSTEM"" and ""IA2_EVENT"" prefixes from the names, so I can just type the first letter of the event in the list when I'm choosing events (e.g. ""s"" for ""state_change""). It's a small thing but makes me faster.  2. Automatic display of relevant data for each event, without having to select columns (this may be difficult with the columnized approach of accProbe). For example, caret move events -> caret offset selection move -> start and end offset text insert -> offset and string that was inserted text removed -> offset and string that was removed etc.  [reply] Comment 5 Kavitha Teegala 2009-03-05 15:31:45 EST Modified Eventy monitor to automatically display of relevant data for Caret events: caret move events -> caret offset selection move -> start and end offset text insert -> offset and string that was inserted text removed -> offset and string that was removed  Ted, please verify and close.

I would change that to ""...about the SML support provided by COSMOS.""  In ""cosmosuserguide09.htm"", it's a bit misleading listing all of that as prerequisites, since a lot of it is already included with COSMOS, such as the schemas and WSDLs.  Also, I believe we removed things like ANTLR and Drools from our prereqs long ago (I think those two were SDD prereqs only).  Right, Jason?  Also Muse is no longer a prereq.  The best source for listing our prereqs is the COSMOS IP Log, as it has been pruned to the correct list.  Under Axis2, you can either refer them to the list in the install guide, list all the required libraries again here, or simply say ""A subset of the Axis2 libraries is required for COSMOS operation"".  In ""cosmosuserguide09C.htm"", shouldn't it be spelled ""Kernel"" not ""Kernal""?  In ""cosmosuserguide13"", I'm not sure what is intended at the bottom, but the last two lines appear in Firefox in a typewriter font with some unresolved characters such as ""<&cursor.""  In ""cosmosuserguide14"", the two missing chapters referenced in the dev guide were collapsed into one at one point.  It's the 2nd chapter in the dev guide that both can reference, whatever that is called now.  In ""cosmosuserguide16"", the word ""describes"" should be ""described"" in the 2nd sentence.  In ""cosmosuserguide18"", the link to the SML spec should be changed to http://www.w3.org/TR/sml/.  Also, please change the bullet right above that link to ""Conforms to the SML-IF and SML specifications, version 1.1"".  And two bullets above that, please change to ""Conforms to ISO Schematron rules bound to documents""  The 3rd and 4th links under ""SML Resources"", should have their versions bumped as follows: # W3C SML Version 1.1 submission # W3C SML Interchange Format Version 1.1 submission And should be linked to: http://www.w3.org/TR/sml/ http://www.w3.org/TR/sml-if/  In ""cosmosuserguide24"", remove the example at the bottom.  It's out of date, and really doesn't add much value.  In ""cosmosuserguide28"", the ""Install Software"" PDF is probably the precursor to the install guide as we know it today.  He is trying to refer to wherever we describe setup for the demo.  Regarding the example, let's hold off for now since we might be allowed to at least refer to Tomcat as an example, pending the Eclipse legal discussion going on.  Hopefully we'll have this resolved by midweek next week.  Seeing that does make me realize our demo installation script still refers to and uses Tomcat to install itself. :-/      [reply] Comment 6 David Whiteman 2008-10-23 17:25:43 EDT Sorry, I hit submit too quickly.  Here are a few more:  In ""cosmosuserguide33"" and the pages that follow, where it says ""Need more information."", you will need to get someone like Srinivas, Jimmy, or JT to write that content.

Several of the items you have aren't listed on that page.

Sorry, I wasn't clear here: I meant I had copied the Prereq table from the Install Guide to the User Guide *after* reading this comment. So both guides have the same Prereq table, which I believe is now correct (save the Axis2 link issue, which we're waiting for Ruth's feedback on).   > > Client Application <Query Service> CMDBf <Query Service> MDR > > CMDBf <Registration Service> MDR > > > > If that¨s not correct, send specific changes. > Looks better, even though I don't know what was originally intended by that > text.

[reply] Comment 9 Richard Vasconi 2008-06-10 14:46:57 EDT Paul, The following text is from an email I received from Mark Mccraw describing the COSMOS Installtion Instructions presentation. I had asked him if there was an update to his presentation. This is his response.  Hey Richard,  I am afraid the installation presentation you attached to your last email was the final draft, and you are welcome to use any material at all out of it that might be of use.  As you know if you listened to the presentation, I'm not the best public speaker, so I had a lot of notes in the presentation to use as a crutch, and you might find as much information in the notes portion of each slide as in the slide itself (I kind of captured loosely what I hoped to say in conjunction with each slide in the notes section).  In particular, the notes for slide 11 might help with the i11 COSMOS demo installation process, but they're a little jumbled, so below is a (hopefully) slightly better and more readable list of steps for installation.  Note that this is just a condensed version of the document that exists already at http://wiki.eclipse.org/COSMOS_DEMO_i11.  Also, note that this only installs the ""server"" portions of COSMOS.  There's a lot of ""client"" stuff in the form of eclipse plugins, but installation of those are all the same:  Download the zips and extract them under eclipse-home/plugins.  1)  Create a folder on your hard drive to hold the downloads you are going to need.  Let's call it C:\cosmos and let's assume that Tomcat is installed at C:\Program Files\Tomcat 2)  Install Tomcat if you haven't already http://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.25/bin/apache-tomcat-5.5.25.exe 3)  Download the following files into C:\cosmos: http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads/drops/M-R1-2.3M6-200804080800/birt-runtime-2.3M6.zip http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.0.2/dojo-release-1.0.2.zip http://www.reverse.net/pub/apache/ws/axis2/1_3/axis2-1.3-war.zip  4)  Download the demo from whatever mirror works best for you: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/cosmos/1.0.0/COSMOS-1.0.0-200806041150/cosmos-demo-incubation-COSMOS-1.0.0-200806041150.zip (Note:  This link reflects the latest build at the time I'm writing this, but it changes often, so check http://www.eclipse.org/downloads for the latest version at any given time) 5)  Unzip the demo into C:\cosmos.  This will create a folder named cosmos-demo 6)  cd to C:\cosmos\cosmos-demo\bin 7)  Run configDemo.bat ""C:\Program Files\Tomcat"" ""C:\cosmos\cosmos-demo"" ""C:\cosmos\birt-runtime-2.3M6.zip"" ""C:\cosmos\dojo-release-1.0.2.zip"" ""C:\cosmos\axis2.war"" 8)  Start tomcat:  C:\Program Files\Tomcat\bin\startup.bat 9)  Register data managers: cd C:\cosmos\cosmos-demo\cosmos-client execute cosmosClient.bat type in ""broker registerAllDataManagers"" 10)  You're done!  Point a browser at http://localhost:8080/COSMOSUI/?page=cosmos     Hope this helps.  Let me know if I can provide any more information for you.

I don't have much time to review thoroughly as I'm on vacation and trying to watch the kids, but here are a couple of quick comments:  * the list of tasks described by the document at the beginning should use consistent word forms.  For example, if most of the words are ""*ing"", then 1,2,6,7 should also use that form.  Like ""planning"", ""checking"", ""downloading"", etc...  * The chapter headings should match the wording in your list exactly.  E.g. you have ""Plan the..."" in the list, but ""Planning..."" in the chapter 2 heading.  * chapter 6, ""COSMOS Builds"": for consistency with the rest of the docs, should use the U.S. spelling of ""utilize""  * Note to Rich: please contact Ali and Saurabh about the build categories, because they are likely to change.  In particular, the last two in that list are probably no longer going to be separate downloads  * Chapter 8, should use ""you"" instead of ""the user"" in documentation.  E.g. ""To install COSMOS, you need to..."".  Note that the list of prereqs will change to remove the RC4 designation when the final versions become available.  * Chapter 9, again write to the user, not about him/her.  I know you copied this from what Saurabh wrote, but the sentences could be a bit less terse.  * Last sentence of chapter 9 worded poorly.  * You have two chapter 9s.  [reply] Comment 13 Hubert Leung 2008-06-20 11:14:31 EDT I see some overlap of information of this document with the rest of the documentation.  The installation of the demo is covered by the ""Running the example"" chapter of the user's guide.  Saurabh also has a set of instructions for installing the SDK on http://wiki.eclipse.org/COSMOS_DEMO_i11#Installing_COSMOS_SDK. (I think the demo page is not the right place for installation instructions for the SDK because the SDK is not part of the end-to-end scenario.)  Another place where we have dependency/installation information is the download page.  We need to define the scope of the install guide, and make sure information is not duplicated elsewhere.

Yes, I made that comment to him before he wrote it that the SDK and SML installation should be on a separate wiki page from the demo setup.  > Another place where we have dependency/installation information is the download > page. > > We need to define the scope of the install guide, and make sure information is > not duplicated elsewhere.  Agreed.  The download page too should point the user to the install guide, so we have a single source for information.

[reply] Comment 17 David Whiteman 2008-10-15 17:52:20 EDT Jimmy, I fixed the mime type of your attachment and also turned off the ""patch"" flag, as that was making it download incorrectly.  This is not a patch, because that implies that you selected the files in Eclipse and exported the changes using ""create patch"" from the CVS menu; this creates a text-based diff format.  You instead attached a zip file that completely replaces the current install guide contents.  I also marked Paul's previous version as obsoleted by this one.  Which file do I start with if I want to view the entire install guide?  I was looking for an index.html.  Overview ======== In the Overview, the text ""provides information to assist adopters to perform the following tasks:"" makes me think the tasks will be phrased as gerunds.  The numbered items should begin with terms like ""Downloading..."", ""Installing..."", etc., since they are named as tasks, and ""Overview of COSMOS components"" is not really a task.  I would also change ""to perform"" to ""in performing"".  Starting COSMOS Components ========================== In ""Starting COSMOS Components"", the following only applies if your web server happens to be Tomcat.  We can't assume that other web servers like JBOSS will have a ""...\bin\startup.bat"".  Therefore, we should leave the following out:  ""Start the web server by running:  <web-server-dir>/bin/startup.bat""  COSMOS Demo Setup ================= The numbering is off in this page, as there are two #1 items.  The first #1 <li> needs to be part of the same <ol> as the rest of them  The comments ""(download from step 4 above)"" and ""(downloaded from step 3 above)"" make no sense in context since this section has no step 3 or 4, or does it have download steps.  Hubert, do we still pass in the location of the axis2 war jar?  COSMOS Demo Web User Interface ============================== I'm surprised we have this as part of the install guide, unless it's just a verification step.  Most of this info should be in the UG or DG, I would think.  At a minimum, we likely have information duplication that will cause maintenance problems.  In the list under Data Managers View, it lists the Statistical Data Manager and Logging Data Manager.  Weren't those recently removed due to IP concerns?  In the places where we say ""COSMOS UI supports/provides"" or something similar, it would probably be best to include the word ""The"" in front.  cosmosinstall.summary.html ========================== There is a lot of garbage text referencing .dita files and type information when you view it in a browser.  It seems this file is no longer used.  If it is not, I would suggest removing the file from the zip.  cosmosinstall.toc.html ====================== This appears to be the ""front page"" I was looking for before.  The ""Version i12"" needs to change to ""Version 1.0"".  Overview of COSMOS Components ============================= We should probably mention MDRs as a specialization of Data Manager here, since those who are coming to this looking for CMDBf support will likely be confused by the Broker / Data Manager talk, or at least will wonder where the MDRs are.  The title of the page doesn't match the heading.  COSMOS Prerequisites ==================== Hubert, do we still recommend people download Axis2 from their web site?  That's what the prereqs list tells them to do.  Downloading COSMOS ================== ""See the COSMOS User Guide for more information about MDR.""  Change ""MDR"" to ""MDRs"".  Installing and running the COSMOS Demo and Prerequisites ======================================================== The links for BIRT and Axis2 are redundant with the links in the prerequisites page.  We should link people to the prereqs page so that we only have to maintain one set of external links for BIRT and Axis2.  Installing the COSMOS SDK ========================= We again have some redundant information here.  The bulleted list provided is basically the same as found in the COSMOS Prerequisites section.  For the final sentence, please refer them specifically to chapter 2 of the Developer Guide, since I don't know if we use the term ""COSMOS SDK"" there.  Even if we do, it's good to point directly to that chapter.  Installing Resource Modeling Tooling ==================================== In this section and the SDK section, shouldn't we also point out the update installer as an alternative means of installing?  Need a space before the 2nd sentence in this section.  Both occurrences of ""SMLIF"" should be ""SML-IF"".  In ""To install resource modeling tooling"" we need to capitalize the R and M.  ""Eclipse SDK 3.4RC4"" should be ""Eclipse SDK 3.4"".  Remove the sentence: ""Note: An alternative to restarting the workbench is to select File > Switch Workspace and click OK to select the current workspace. This operation causes Eclipse to reload all features and plug-ins.""  Instead add the following sentence: ""To do this, select File > Restart from the workbench menu.""  I'm not sure of the purpose of Manual Installation.  It seems basically the same as automatic, except that you unzip it to the hard drive before copying it over.  Again, I think we want to instead contrast unzipping the download with using the update installer.  ""Modelling"" should be ""Modeling"".  Uninstall COSMOS ================ From the TOC, I clicked on ""Uninstall COSMOS"" and got a page not found.  I think there is a typo in the URL.  Also we should call it ""Uninstalling"", not ""Uninstall"" for consistent word usage.     [reply] Comment 18 Ruth Lee 2008-10-16 11:22:43 EDT 1. If we have broken links in the TOC, then we need to run some basic verification on the docs such as a broken links checker, spell checker, etc. 1.1 If the docs are to be shipped in a plug-in, then we can use the doc verification tool that TPTP wrote to verify our docs. It looks for broken links, orphaned files (i.e., files not referred to by the TOC, which means that their information is not searchable), and I forget what else. This is a basic quality step that we will need to do. 1.2 If the docs are to be web based alone, then let's run a quick check on any of the basics using any tool at all.  2. We need to be careful about the 3rd party code that we list or refer to. We can refer to only the items for which we have a fully approved CQ. For Axis2, for example, we do not have permission to use Axis2 in its entirety; instead, we can refer to the specific versions of the specific JARs that we have permission for. I understand that makes our documentation more clunky but that's all that we have legal clearance for.  3. The ""in research"" portions of COSMOS have CQs that are not cleared and we might need to move those portions to another guide just for ""in research"" components.

I wasn't suggesting moving anything.  I was just assuming (without looking, mind you) that much of this information was already described in those documents, and that we can just refer them elsewhere for more detail like we already do at the bottom of that section.  In general, it is good for us to have a single copy of anything, given that when things change, it's easy to forget (and time consuming) to update all places where the information exists.  But I realize there's a usability tradeoff in making people hop around between different documents.  > In the list under Data Managers View, it lists the Statistical Data Manager and > Logging Data Manager.  Weren't those recently removed due to IP concerns? > Remove?  OK, I did some fact checking on this (yes, too much watching debate analysis).  The statistical data manager is likely still in.  Sheldon or Hubert can probably confirm.  The logging data manager includes CBE, which had to be (or will be) removed from the build; Ruth is checking to see if we can reference the CBE plugin itself instead.  I don't know what I'm talking about, so I'll stop there.  I trust someone else will let you know if the logging data manager instructions have to be removed.  > Overview of COSMOS Components > ============================= > We should probably mention MDRs as a specialization of Data Manager here, since > those who are coming to this looking for CMDBf support will likely be confused > by the Broker / Data Manager talk, or at least will wonder where the MDRs are. > I found this online C can you please add/change anything if it¨s not appropriate: > One classification of a Data Manager is a Management Data Repository (MDR).

Where did you get the prereqs list from?  If it's based on the old copy of the install guide that Paul wrote, it's out of date.  We learned that we don't have legal approval to prereq all of Axis2, just parts of it.  So what we need to do is provide the list of legally approved Axis2 libraries that they will need to download to use COSMOS.  That's the list I was referring to in Comment #23 of this defect.  > Installing and running the COSMOS Demo and Prerequisites > ======================================================== > The links for BIRT and Axis2 are redundant with the links in the prerequisites > page.

But in this case, here's my dilemma, if you will. The Prereqs for COSMOS list two downloads the SDK doesn't need: Java5 and BIRT. So if I refer users to the COSMOS Prereqs page from the SDK page, do I tell them something like ""Install every download listed on the Prereqs page, with the exception of Java5 and BIRT."" Then I'd also have to tell them to download the COSMOS SDK. I'm torn if that makes more sense, or if not having every download identified in a bulleted list would be annoying to the user. I also think I'm contemplating this too much. Any thoughts?

So really the only thing you would have them skip is BIRT.  But I will leave it up to you to do as you think is best.

COSMOS SDK and SML Tooling can also be installed using Update site installer, however the current site - ""http://download.eclipse.org/technology/cosmos/1.0.0/update-site"" is not upto date, it's pointing to very old builds.

The CBE logging data manager should be removed as it references TPTP jars to parse CBEs.  I can't advice if we should remove the logging data manager instruction if Ruth still thinks we can reference the CBE plugin instead.  However, this might complicate the builds and hence complicate how adopters will run the COSMOS demo.  I'm not sure if keeping the logging data manager is worth while.  We have the statistical report to demonstrate a data manager that is not an MDR.  It also demonstrates a custom report based on a data manager.

2009-02-17 23:16:18 EST,225892,Example EMF workflow model,"Example EMF workflow model [reply] Description Bryan Hunt 2008-04-06 01:11:56 EDT Here is an example EMF workflow model.  The model allows you to create a pure EMF workflow, or to mix in POJOS.  Both types of models will run standalone.  Only the pure EMF workflow will run in an OSGi runtime.  I didn't want to deal with ""classloader hell"" in the simple example.  The code was generated with EMF 2.4.0M6.  The attached workflow.zip contains the workflow model, the EMF generated editor, an action to run the workflow from a runtime workbench, an example of a user supplied EMF workflow component (LogMessage), and an example of a user supplied POJO workflow component (Hello).  The attached test.zip contains some example workflow models.  Import the project into your runtime workbench.  You may right-click on the emf.workflow and select ""Run Workflow"" to execute the workflow.  The pojo.workflow can only be executed successfully from the command line.  To run the sample workflows from the command line, create a Java launch configuration.  On the Main tab, the Project should be set to org.eclipse.emf.wf.core, and the Main class is org.eclipse.emf.workflow.main.Workflow.  On the Arguments tab, the first program argument should be the path to the workflow to execute, for example, ${workspace_log}/../test/workflow/test/pojo.workflow.  The Classpath tab should include the following projects / plugins: org.eclipse.emf.wf.core, org.eclipse.emf.wf.examples, org.eclipse.emf.common_2.4.0.v200804012208.jar, org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi_2.4.0.v200804012208.jar, and org.eclipse.emf.ecore_2.4.0.v200804012208.jar.  To create a new workflow, you may create the XMI with your favorite editor using the samples as a template, or you may use the generated editor in the runtime workbench.  Launch the runtime workbench, create a new generic project, create a new Example EMF Model Creation Wizards -> Workflow Model.  Click Next and give the a model a name with a .workflow extension.  Click Next and choose Composite Workflow Component as the Model Object.  Click Finish.  When the editor appears, add a new child to the Composite Workflow Component of either Message or Pojo Workflow Component.  Use the properties view to configure the children.

Implementing a transformation for your model would allow you to use the full JWT editor feature set (including export to other BPM formats).  We'd be willing to help you do this. There are already good samples : look in the eclipse technology.jwt CVS, the ""transformations"" subtree contains a sample stub transformation you may start with, as well as several working transformations that will show you how to use ATL or XSL as transformation technologies (if you'd rather use JET or Acceleo, we got tutorials - well, any technology is ok !).   In addition, I note an interesting point about your sample : it showcases how your model may be extended concretized, meaning that in addition to the core workflow model, domain specific workflow model (especially domain specific actions and task implementations) inheriting from it can be defined.  This can be done in JWT, but for now such extended actions would not show differently in the UI, so their specific properties could not be set and therefore they would not be any more useful than normal actions.  However, we're currently working on how to allow to extend the JWT metamodel, which will imply being able to display such extended properties in the UI, which would fill you needs. So we're both rather in the same mindset ;)  Your sample / idea about this advocates a typed action extension mechanism. Another one would be mere key-value pairs on actions, which is simpler. I rather like the idea of typing actions since the PVM runtime (common future Bonita and jBPM BPM engine) does the same, and it would allow to control consistency of action types within a business process, as well as which ones are for example BPEL-compatible versus XPDL-compatible.  However if typing is too harsh it might be cumbersome to do extensions. Typically, having to write another EMF model whenever a custom property needs to be added and generate its companion Java code is a development task but (I think) should not be one, since mere users might want such custom properties.  I'm putting the dev mailing list (jwt-dev@eclipse.org , you're welcome to subscribe) on cc so we can go further on this :)   Regards Marc Dutoo JWT Team co-lead Open Wide  Mickael Istria wrote:  > Bryan Hunt a └crit : > >> I just ran across the Eclipse JWT project and it seems that it either overlaps or compliments MWE - I'm not quite sure which.

(However, I am not a wise old man in JWT -and Eclipse more generally-, so that I apologize in advance if I make mistakes).   MWE is a modeler for workflow based on EMF. According to what I quickly saw when I tried it, it defines a metamodel for workflows, and allows users to write and run a workflow defined in this metamodel.  JWT is aimed to be a complete and generic tool for workflow designers. It includes a graphical editor that allows to ""draw"" a workflow. It uses an internal metamodel for workflows which is compatible with AgilPro Workflow Engine. In the future, JWT should include some runtime tools that would allow user to monitor his workflow from JWT with a large and open set of workflow engines (we are currently focusing on Bonita).  We recently integrated into JWT a transformation framework to give it more compatibility with other standards such as XPDL, BPMN... (the list is short for the time, but it may be extended). XPDL will give to JWT the ability to design workflows that will be compatible with Bonita, and BPMN will make JWT compatible with other graphical workflow editors.  As you can see, we are trying to make JWT as complete and general as possible.   The thought that came to my mind when I discovered MWE workflow engine was: ""JWT could handle it"". Including a new workflow engine into JWT can be done in a few steps (that may not be so easy to implement than to desctibe them): - Extend editor and JWT metamodel to make them support additional informations necessary to your metamodel (that is the most difficult point since changing metamodel must be done cleverly) - Add a transformation from JWT internal metamodel to your workflow engine metamodel, so that JWT can produce MWE files - and, if you want a full integration, add a launcher for your workflow engine, and everything to call it from the UI.    I hope that all this monologue answered your questions, and that it gave you some ideas for a possible future compatibility between JWT and MWE.

I've added the ability to model inputs, outputs, and connect them together.  The next thing I want to model is forwarding an output from a UnitOfWork to it's parent composite.  I'm not completely satisfied with the way inputs and outputs are modeled, so if there are any better suggestions, I'm happy to hear them.  One thing that would be interesting is to validate a constraint that a component with an output must be executed before a component with an input connected to that output.  Anybody have any good pointers on how to get started with the EMF validation framework?  I think the next big piece is parameterization of a component.

I'm not quite following your comments.  When you talk about key value pairs, I'm wondering if you are talking about what I might consider parameterization of the workflow component where the component might have a set of keys is uses to look up parameter values supplied by the user at runtime in a map.

One thing to note for others that might be interested in this work:  MWE is currently not based on EMF, and thus the intent of this bugzilla is to propose such an EMF model.  [reply] Comment 9 Marc Dutoo 2008-04-18 14:08:53 EDT Yep, exactly.  Basically, free form (property map-like) data on Actions (executable tasks) is useful for the end user to use like annotations without requiring heavy development. Typing or subtyping actions is interesting for workflow validation and consistency check and developing domain specific sub Actions.  Note that there is an interesting discussion ongoing in the JWT developer mailing list with someone else that is in the same position as your are, you're welcome. I'll try to feed information.

[reply] Comment 19 Marc Dutoo 2008-05-19 09:31:16 EDT Hi Bryan  I've taken a look at your updates, here is my feedback.  ""The idea is that a editor could treat the composite as a black box and show only the inputs and outputs of the composite."" -> I like the ""black box"" point of view, it is very much in sync with allowing any kind of JWT Action / WorkflowComponent extensions, and with my latest tries in enabling extensibility of the JWT model (more soon on mailing list).  From what I've understood (please correct me if I'm wrong), you want to make primarily a runtime workflow model, i.e. a workflow model that not only can be executed but has even runtime state information in it.  So it is not surprising that your model has quite a few things in it that are only runtime (and not devtime) : WorkflowState, WorkflowEngine... This ""runtime"" flavour has the advantage of making it a model that can directly be run (if only at development time by the developer). However I'd still advise to carefully make the separation between devtime information and runtime information.  For example, maybe XxxWorkflowOrchestrator should be renamed to something like XxxWorkflowOrchestrationStrategy, therefore making it more like information and less like actual runtime implementation ?  Maybe Florian and other Augsburg U. contributors have some input from their JWT Simulator experience on how to tread the line between devtime and runtime when ""executing"" an EMF workflow model.  Simplifying parameters is good.  A simple way to map a JWT model to your model would be : CompositeWorkflowComponents correspond with JWT StructuredActivityNode, and custom WorkflowComponent extension implementations will be the forecoming JWT Action extension (your endeavours are my inspiration on this side ;). I think this should be straightforward and powerful enough for you to use. Another, more powerful but more complex, would be to use pattern detection strategy like in BPEL generation (see below).  Since your model is EMF, you could use ATL to implement the transformation we've talked about in your jwt2mwe transformation plugin. Mickael has just written a doc about ATL here : http://wiki.eclipse.org/JWT_Transformations#About_ATL .   Finally, some ""philosophying"" about your workflow semantics (I mean how the engine decides which next WorkflowComponent is must run) and how it matches with JWT.  From what I've read, your workflows are mainly recursive compositions of CompositeWorkflowComponent and custom WorkflowComponent extension implementations, and execution of a given Composite is governed by its strategy parameter (XxxWorkflowOrchestrator). This gives it a definitive bloc-oriented, bpel-like, recursive orchestration feel.  It is quite different from the JWT metamodel, which is rather an oriented graph (node and transition -oriented). Anyway Augsburg U. has already generated BPEL from JWT (and there will be other JWT to BPEL mappings in the future as well) so the semantics and execution paradigms should map well with yours as well. The bottom line is we're very committed to also support tooling for orchestration and BPEL-like processes (we'd even be open to add another, orchestration-minded native format to the JWT suite, with optimal transformation support).  For now there are no conditional transition in your model. I guess it will appear in a ConditionalWorkflowOrchestrator, as well as other types of transitions.  Finally, note that the JWT native metamodel has a better support of usual workflow patterns (as defined at workflowpatterns.org ), while yours has a better support of orchestration concepts and strategies, such as loops.  Marc  [reply] Comment 20 Bryan Hunt 2008-05-20 00:42:42 EDT Marc,  Thanks for the feedback.  Your understanding of the design is spot-on.  Keeping the runtime state information as part of the workflow model seems to be the simplest design.  The downside is, as you pointed out, that it pollutes the design-time model.  I would love to keep the design-time model separate from the runtime model, but I don't see a clear way to do this without duplicating a lot of information and making the implementation complicated.  Ideas on this are welcome.  Consider the following use-case:  A workflow starts executing unattended, and somewhere in the middle say after step 4, an error is encountered.  The workflow is persisted with its state information.  Sometime later, a user inspects the failing workflow, fixes the error, and re-submits the workflow for execution.  The workflow needs to be able to start execution from where it left off.  It is possible for the original workflow model to have changed between the time the workflow originally executed and the time it was re-run.  The result of a workflow execution must be reproducible at a later point in time.  This is one of the primary use cases that's driving the design, and the ability to persist the model with it's state information.  Another interesting use-case is the ability for an AE to create a standard workflow that can then be customized by a user maybe using a specialized editor.  I've been considering how to do conditional transitions, and I think it will work as part of the orchestration strategy.  The interesting (hard) part will be the ability to view the workflow as a connected graph.  It seems fairly straight-forward to go from a connected graph to a composite model, but not so easy the other way around.  Where do you draw the boundaries?  I wonder if some sort of annotation would work?  I think the next work items are a better state model, re-run policy, and conditional transitions.  I'm going to dwell on these a bit, and maybe a fresh perspective will inspire a creative solution.   [reply] Comment 21 Ed Merks 2008-05-20 08:28:30 EDT I suppose one approach to the separation is kind of a decorator model in much the same way that the GenModel is a decorator for the Ecore model containing all the information that's not intrinsically part of the model (i.e., information that is needed to support a dynamic instance of the model) but rather information that will help direct how code is generated for the model.  I imagine that would certainly complicate the design significantly...  [reply] Comment 22 Bryan Hunt 2008-05-20 08:42:30 EDT One idea that occurred to me this morning to deal with the currentState would be to make that reference read-only.  However, I seem to recall that EMF has a problem with de-serialization when your attributes and references are read-only.  Ed?  A design similar to the ecore / genmodel is basically what I was referring to in my comments on separating the design-time information from the runtime information, and that design point being complicated.  I wonder if this issue might drive EMF enhancements?  [reply] Comment 23 Bryan Hunt 2008-05-20 08:46:45 EDT Another idea I just had would be to maybe store the currentState in the WorkflowContext.  I could use a Map with the WorkflowComponent as the key.  [reply] Comment 24 Ed Merks 2008-05-20 08:50:52 EDT To deserialize, the feature must be changeable reflectively, but EMF does support suppressing accessors from the API so you could suppress the set method from the interface to make it difficult though not impossible to change the value.  The GenModel supports methods like reconcile() to automatically update itself relative to the latest state of the underlying Ecore model.  It's all relatively simple, but of course not as simple as just a single model.  It does seem better to me to separate the runtime model from the design time model, even if it does complicate the overall picture somewhat...  The mapped approach is effectively equivalent to a decorator model.  I.e., the key references the model being decorated and the value is the decorating information.

I've added a WorkflowComponentOrchestrationStrategy that controls the execution of the component.  ConditionalWorkflowComponentOrchestrationStrategy extends this, and provides for conditional execution of the component.  This mechanism also allows me to provide a re-run policy based on the current state of the component.  I think the majority of the modeling is now complete.

[reply] Comment 33 Peter Friese 2008-06-04 07:04:43 EDT Hi Bryan, thanks for your contributions. We are currently taking a deeper look at your code and the architectural ideas behind it and will probably come up with some questions soon. In the meantime, I'd like to take the chance to elaborate a bit on the goals of the EMF Modeling Workflow Engine (MWE for short) and the requirements that are derived from these goals.  The original purpose of the MWE is to provide a lightweight, easy-to-use way to configure and run code generator components. The documentation (http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/doc/4.3/html/contents/workflow_reference.html) states that ""The oAW 4 workflow engine is a declarative configurable generator engine. It provides a simple, XML-based configuration language with which all kinds of generator workflows can be described. A generator workflow consists of a number of so-called workflow components that are executed sequentially in a single JVM.""  I have to admit that we're using the term ""workflow"" in a rather light-hearted way. If you have a look at what we actually need to do with MWE, you will find that the workflows we model with MWE are rather straight-forward. Have a look at the following workflows to get a hint of what we do with MWE: http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/doc/4.3/html/contents/emf_tutorial.html#emf_tutorial_generating_code, www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2007/ presentations/ESE2007_Model-Friese-oAWAndOCL.pdf . Let me point out a few things: all workflows are sequential (you read a model, you validate it, you transform it, you put it into the generator to generate code, you're done). As you can see from the second sample (the PDF), writing a workflow component is a straight-forward process and does not require anything moe than a Java editor.  The current implementation of MWE makes heavy use of dependency injection (thus using Java reflection) to allow for an easy way to create workflows. This approach has proven to be very versatile and allows us to assemble all kinds of component compositions. To put it short: we're quite satisfied with the runtime aspects of MWE.  There are, however, aspects of the current implementation which could and should be improved - mostly tooling-related. As you can see, the current implementation makes use of XML as serialization format which is fine. However, the XML editor we wrote is quite basic and doesn't sport the same level of user assistance as we all have become used to from JDT (or ANT). This is an area in which we surely would appreciate help from the community.  Anyway, we're evaluating your contribution and will get back to you with questions regarding your ideas these days.  Thanks again, Peter  [reply] Comment 34 Bryan Hunt 2008-06-04 08:11:35 EDT Peter, thank you for your comments.  One thing I would like to point out is that between the extensibility of my model (see the pojo example), and the ability to provide a custom serializer, I believe I can meet all of your requirements.  [reply] Comment 35 Sven Efftinge 2008-06-04 10:53:22 EDT Hi Brian,  I think it's a good idea to start with the requirements (the user's perspective). I've been a user of MWE (formely oAW workflow engine) for about two years now, and so far I'm quite happy with what it does and how it works.  The main requirements for an MWE like I use it are: - light weight - convenient - as well eclipse independent and eclipse integrated modeling and execution should be possible - good tooling - open and configurable  The current version does all of this. Only the tooling isn't that good yet. So this would be an area where I think the project needs some improvements. One could also argue that XML isn't the syntax of our dreams, but as MWE uses it in a very non-verbose manner it isn't too bad. Maybe an additional alternative syntax would be cool.  To be honest, I haven't fully understood all the concepts you introduced in your approach, but modeling every workflow component up front using EMF (I think this was the key idea) and then implementing the operations by changing the generated code, is much more work than doing it in simple Java like one does with MWE. It also forces me to change generated code. Neither I want to do that nor most of my colleagues.  The alternative (using PojoWorkflowComponent) would be the way most people use it. Unfortunately the modeling of the PojoWorkflowComponent like it is in your approach is very generic. All in all the model becomes less readable and harder to write. I'm sorry, but I don't see any benefits in this approach (actually the contrary is the case).  One of the most important features of the current workflow engine is dependency injection (DI), with which one can wire and compose arbitrary Java objects up (i.e. configuring workflow components with complex service graphs). I haven't found something like this in your current implementation. Don't you need something like this or do you manage more complex configuration of workflow components differently? Or am I just blind?  I noticed the discussion about whether JWT could handle what MWE does. I think the question is not whether something could handle something, but whether it is a good idea to do it that way.  The term 'workflow' is of course heavily overused. In the context of MWE workflow means something different than in the context of JWT. In the MWE case it's just an object graph configured declaratively using DI which is composed of Objects implementing an interface (IWorkflowEngine). I don't want to model MWE workflows like business processes. They are just generator configurations.  Although I don't see any needs to do a complete rework of the workflow engine, I really would like to see it growing. Integrating your ideas and contributions could help as long as they fit the user's needs (requirements). As I said, I didn't understand all the concepts included in your prototype, so maybe we could talk about those concepts and see if they are helpful in the context of MWE and how we could integrate them?  My 2 cents  [reply] Comment 36 Bryan Hunt 2008-06-04 11:24:38 EDT Sven, I think the piece of the picture you are missing is the combination of using the PoJoWorkflowComponent together with a custom serializer.  Combining these two would allow someone to write a declarative workflow in XML just like you have today.  The serializer would construct the necessary pieces of the EMF model into an executable workflow.  For this use case, no EMF modeling is required.  [reply] Comment 37 Ed Merks 2008-06-04 11:56:58 EDT The fact that the workflow model isn't a model seems to quite odd to me.  One would expect all the modeling technology of the modeling project to be applicable to the workflow model.  E.g., a GMF view might be a cool thing.  But as it stands, none of it is applicable...  Taking the position of ""generating models is more work than hand writing code"" and on top of that taking the position that ""we don't modify generated code"" certainly isn't a position I expect an EMF committer to take; perhaps you didn't intend to make it sound like a sweeping value judgment and I've taken it out of context but it does sound like one. Given that these are fundamental aspects in how the vast majority of EMF's users use EMF, I'm surprised to see it.  Probably I'm reading too much into the comment.  Probably questions of blindness are a bit undiplomatic.  It's important to consider that what we want personally is not always what everyone else wants so making things flexible to support different desires is often a good approach.  Here's an example of something I'd rather not support, but the community expressed their desire and put their development resource where there desires are:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233843  [reply] Comment 38 Peter Friese 2008-06-04 13:45:08 EDT (In reply to comment #34) > Peter, thank you for your comments.

We need to support a large exising user base and need to make sure that they can use the tolling (i.e. an XML editor) in the way they are used to. Having the serializer would help us evaluating whether this requirement is met.

Contrary, I think this would be good as we could leverage many technologies. The point is, how it is used. I really (and I say and always said *I*) don't want to model everything up front and then change generated code.

I'ld neither generally say ""generating code is more work than hand writing code"" nor the other way round. It depends on the problem to solve. I always try to see what I want to do and than find the best way making use of my mental tool box (where code generation is just one tool (although a very valuable one)).  *I*'ve had some bad experiences with modifying generated code in the past, and therefore think it's bad practice (Sorry). I found that there are many other (and IMHO better) ways to integrate generated and manually written code.

Maybe it's my imperfect English. I didn't what to be undiplomatic. I tried to say ""I think"" and ""IMHO"" as often as I could to make clear that everything I say of course is always ""my opinion"". And I'm perfectly fine with supporting approaches I personally don't need, as long as they cannot be done in a simple, yet supported manner. Providing different ways for the same task often makes tools complicated and error prone. I really would like to discuss the needs (requirements) and then see if we are talking about the same requirements and if so, whether we could design something fitting all of our needs.  > Here's an example of something I'd rather not support, but the community > expressed their desire and put their development resource where there desires > are: > >   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233843 >  Taking the position ""The I-Pattern for interfaces is rubbish"" certainly isn't a position I expect an Eclipse committer to take... just kidding :-) I see your point.

I think it's indeed a very good idea to design the AST of workflow descriptions using EMF and then provide different Resource implementations to provide different syntaxes (this is what you ment by serializer, right?). Maybe we could go for a compromise where the AST is modeled in EMF and the classes to instantiate and wire it up are just Java classes. As generated EClasses are also Java classes both approaches would work.  We would come up with tooling using JDT to statically help modeling the workflows (looking up subclasses of IWorkflowComponent, as well as inspecting the setters and adders). This way we'ld have separated things and support all of our favored ways with the same concepts.  It would help if you could come up with things you missed in MWE and what motivated you to create your own thing.  Sorry, if I was too undiplomatic in my first post.

I'd like to understand what the particular benefits of your design are. I am *not* talking about why it might be a good idea to use EMF, but instead would like to understand what you are aiming at. Do you intend to provide a better tooling / tighter integration with other Eclipse projects like JWT / more flexible approach to workflow modeling / use MWE as an execution engine for business workflows?   [reply] Comment 45 Ed Merks 2008-06-05 07:35:48 EDT We actually had alternative ways to avoid modifying generated code before we came up with the JMerge approach.  That approach involved a pair of interfaces, generated and user modifiable, and a pair of classes, again, generated and user modifiable.  The approach was bloated, both in terms of files and in terms of extra byte code; even an empty class or interface leads to very significant overhead. It was also conceptually more complex and was a highly artificial pattern, i.e., not anything like how you'd design it by hand.  Ultimately the approach was abandoned for all these reasons, and a few die hard purists who believe generated code should not be touched weren't so happy about that.  Of course some people will always feel that generated code shouldn't be touched and perhaps not even committed to their repository.  They're entitled to their opinion, but generally change their opinion over time since most tools can't produce 100% satisfactory results.  Given I've been working this way for the last seven years and have never had a bad experience, I'd be curious about the nature of the bad experiences.  Eclipse keeps a history so even overwriting your changes, should you forget to remove @generated from a changed method is easily recoverable.  That's even more the case when you keep your code in a repository. Using the approach of renaming the generated method to *Gen and calling it, you can even ensure the future regenerated changes are picked up.  Of course I can see that actually changing the body of a method and removing @generated means you'll not pick of enhancements in the future, so definitely there are some disadvantages, although if the changes are merely to implement an EOperation in Java, there's not going to be changes in the future.  Of course it's possible to write an operation as an annotation on the operation as well; it's good to keep the purists happy too. :-P  In any case, everyone is definitely entitled to their opinion though I will always argue strongly with anyone who says modifying generated code is just generally a bad practice.  It's one of the pillars that has made EMF successful so if it's bad practice, it's one that has proven highly valuable and broadly appealing.  Touche on the ""I-pattern"" jibe. :-P Hehehe.  I do think it's an extremely unfortunate choice and I noticed that SWT didn't choose it either...  So sorry for the harsh criticism. I like to see the community function well where everyone's opinions are respected and where folks consider carefully what it's like to be at the receiving end of their commentary.  It's very hard to foster a climate of collaboration since people can and will have many legitimate differences of opinion.  In the ideal world, those differences lead to a diverse community that supports the diverse usage patterns of the users.  It's definitely very constructive to find out what Byran's design philosophy is and compare that to what's driven the project so far.  Do you guys imagine it might be possible to design a syntax other than XML for a workflow?  I guess it needs to be extensible although I could imagine supporting some type of generalized name/property syntax in the base grammar.  I'm a bit sick of XML pretending to be a human-readable syntax and I know you folks are doing some very cool things in that domain.  A workflow language with a nice human readable syntax, a high end editor, perhaps including graphical views of the flows would be pretty cool in the long term.  Did you guys ever write an XML Schema for the XML syntax?  That would certainly help make it clear the intended model of the syntax and what needs to be parsed and printed...

It's one of the pillars that has made EMF successful > so if it's bad practice, it's one that has proven highly valuable and broadly > appealing.  IMHO, EMF's success in the modeling world is not based on it's generation capabilities but on the Ecore model, it's reflection layer and all the cool technologies and concepts around it (resource, validation, transaction, etc.). The generator is useful if you want to write Java against models. In the context of code generation (at least with most generation and transformation languages) dynamic EMF is absolutely sufficient, as the languages map everything to Ecore's reflection layer no matter if it's a dynamic EObject or not.  Of course there are also cases where you want to program Java against the models and therefore the generator is cool and very important. It's just not the main reason *I* use EMF.  regarding JMerge: It's indeed primarily a user problem. I've forgotten to remove the @generated tag so many times. Although I could reproduce the code in most cases those experiences scared me somehow... In addition I have to version generated code which causes merge conflicts, the imports are not updated, elements removed from an ecore model have to be removed from the code base manually and finally JMerge works for Java only.  > > Touche on the ""I-pattern"" jibe. :-P Hehehe.  I do think it's an extremely > unfortunate choice and I noticed that SWT didn't choose it either...  Yes, the things we program against should be free of technical pre- or suffixes. Anyway, the 'I' is no problem for me because it's short.  > > So sorry for the harsh criticism.

Yes, it's important to make the different points clear first. This might sound a bit unfriendly sometimes (it's never meant personally) but in the end we may all know what we are talking about.  > > Do you guys imagine it might be possible to design a syntax other than XML for > a workflow? > I guess it needs to be extensible although I could imagine > supporting some type of generalized name/property syntax in the base grammar. > I'm a bit sick of XML pretending to be a human-readable syntax and I know you > folks are doing some very cool things in that domain.  A workflow language with > a nice human readable syntax, a high end editor, perhaps including graphical > views of the flows would be pretty cool in the long term.   Of course. We've been thinking about form based, graphical and alternative textual syntaxes (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=218806). I think the goal is to make it easy to combine different syntaxes for EMF based languages in general by combining GMF, TMF and other technologies. As you know we're currently working on the TMF part. MWE will be one of our first applications for it. Still we need to support the current user base, but that shouldn't be much of a problem in this case.   > > Did you guys ever write an XML Schema for the XML syntax?  That would certainly > help make it clear the intended model of the syntax and what needs to be parsed > and printed...  It's not possible because we don't use XML in it's generic fashion. Instead of writing: ... <parameter name=""foo""> <bean class=""foo.Bar""> <parameter name=""foo"" value=""bar""/> <parameter name=""nested""> <bean class=""foo.Bar2""> <parameter name=""stuff"" value=""apa""/> </bean> </parameter> </bean> </parameter> ...  where you could of course come up with a schema declaring 'parameter' and 'bean' we write ... <foo class=""foo.Bar"" foo=""bar""> <nested class=""foo.Bar2"" stuff=""apa""/> </foo> ...  As you see, we use just the syntax of XML (the decision was made in order to not scare users with yet another syntax). We tried hard to make it as non-verbose and readable as possible.

I probably can't explain why I need these requirements without disclosing confidential information, so I'm just going to list the requirements.  The workflow model and runtime must be: * Lightweight * Easily persisted * Transportable to a distributed computing environment for execution * Capable of execution of where it left off in the event of a component failure - Successful components must not be re-executed * Capable of extending the functionality of parameters - Simple key = value pairs are not sufficient * Capable of executing components in parallel * Capable of executing components conditionally * Capable of extending the possible execution result states * Capable of providing a rich editor for both the workflow model and parameter values - I think GMF might fit nicely for a workflow editor * Capable of specifying parameter values separate from the workflow model * Capable of providing different algorithms for determining the final execution state of a composite  While this is not a requirement, IMHO, a project that is part of EMFT should be based on EMF.  [reply] Comment 51 Sven Efftinge 2008-06-12 09:53:40 EDT Thanks, for giving some insights. I can of course understand that you're not able to tell us details about your project.

Note, that we distinct between the AST of a workflow description and the tree which is instantiated based on such a description. While the AST indeed should and will be based on EMF the latter shouldn't. Instead it is just an arbitrary Java object graph instantiated via dependency injection. The language and the DI container, doesn't even know about WorkflowComponent. Of course, it should be and is possible to use Java classes, which are based on EMF (i.e. generated by EMF).  As the AST will be based on EMF, we're able to reuse remoting technology based on EMF. Would that fit the requirement?  > * Capable of execution of where it left off in the event of a component failure >   - Successful components must not be re-executed  What if a failure is based on a previous component making a fault (e.g. wrong model transformation, corrupting the model)?  > * Capable of extending the functionality of parameters >   - Simple key = value pairs are not sufficient  Yes, this is what dependency injection does.  > * Capable of executing components in parallel  +1  > * Capable of executing components conditionally  +1 (We already have that, but it could of course be bit more sophisticated ;-))  > * Capable of extending the possible execution result states  Could you please elaborate on this?

What is an 'execution state'? Is it a new concept you'ld like to introduce, which states whether a workflow component were executed successfully or not?

This is what I've written so far : http://wiki.eclipse.org/MWE_The_Big_Picture  First of all, I'ld like to say, that I found some of the concepts you introduced very interesting. Especially the ExecutionStatus and the possibility to execute workflows in parallel are great additions.  During the call I already mentioned that it won't be much of a problem to instantiate your model using our di-language.  A description of your example model would look like this (I already wrote a test to ensure it works):  WorkflowCompositeComponent { components = MessageGenerator { parameters += :output { type	 = ""java.lang.String"" name	 = ""OutputMessage"" description	= ""Output message"" } } components = LogMessage { parameters += :input { type     = ""java.lang.String"" name     = ""InputMessage"" description = ""Input message"" connection  = :con { output = output inputs += input } } } compositeOrchestrationStrategy = SerialWorkflowOrchestrationStrategy {} connections += con stateResolutionStrategy = {} }  (Note that this is just the textual syntax. As there is an EMF model under the hood you could of course use other syntaxes as well. Also note that the textual editor is based on Xtext 2.0 (currently in development under TMF) and will provide all kinds of nice tooling (code completion, validation, etc.))  As the di-language should remain independent of any runtime model concepts in order to support alternative runtime models, it's the job of the runtime model designer to ensure that configurations are convenient to edit and read for the user. Hopefully you're able to tweak the model a bit in order to improve that (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/MWE_The_Big_Picture for informations on how to do it).  Hopefully the descriptions I made are understandable and that there are not too many errors in it.

Sven,  Could you please elaborate a bit more on this comment.  I'm not currently understanding your concern here.  On a different topic ... in your description of the Runtime Workflow Model, you mention that a component should have optional life cycle methods.  Did you have an API in mind for this?  The IWorkflowComponent API in my proposal was created to illustrate how the model might interface to a POJO.  If you have an API, I'd like to see if I can get it to work with my proposed model.  My IWorkflowComponent example also exposes the concept of workflow execution state to the POJO.  Do you think this would be desirable, or overly complicating the interface to the POJO?  I think this same question is also valid for the parameters.  Should the POJO see the parameters directly as part of the context, or just see the result of calling setter methods on the POJO?  [reply] Comment 54 Bryan Hunt 2008-06-29 11:05:23 EDT Created attachment 106078 [details] EMF workflow model  Workflow parameter values are now modeled as a WorkflowParameterValue instead of an EJavaObject.

Perhaps you want a parameter to be simply EObject to allow any EObject and when you need to pass a data value, you'd create an instance of SimpleAnyType.  Of course I could be completely missing the boat.  [reply] Comment 56 Bryan Hunt 2008-06-30 09:25:05 EDT Ed, thanks for your comments.  SimpleAnyType may be exactly what I'm looking for.

I'm not currently > understanding your concern here.  A simple example: Let's say you want to have a parallel execution of workflow components. With the current API, it's necessary to configure a workflow component with a strategy. The code/model looks something like this:  WorkflowCompositeComponent { compositeOrchestrationStrategy = ParallelWorkflowOrchestrationStrategy {} ... components }  One might find the following notation a bit more ""intentional"":  Parallel { ...components }  To make this possible with the MWE-DI language one has different possibilities:  1) register a custom factory, creating the readily configured WorkflowCompositeComponent for the name 'Parallel'  2) write a class with name 'Parallel' having the needed semantics (e.g. extending WorkflowCompositeComponent and have the ParallelWorkflowOrchestrationStrategy pre-configured).  This is just one instance, of how you one can improve the descriptiveness of a workflow description (other possibilities are described in http://wiki.eclipse.org/MWE_The_Big_Picture)  > > On a different topic ... in your description of the Runtime Workflow Model, you > mention that a component should have optional life cycle methods.

Regarding parameters: There are two different kinds of parameters one being workflow component specific setup configuration. This kind of configuration is handled through the DI language. The other type are runtime parameters (e.g. a model passed from one to another component). So far WorkflowComponents communicate via slots in a WorkflowContext. I saw that you've introduced new concepts like connections and parameters. Is there a specific reason why you came up with these new things as opposed to stick with the simple WorkflowContext slots?

I would think option 1 or something similar: create an instance of WorkflowCompositeComponent and an instance of ParallelWorkflowOrchestrationStrategy, then call setCompositeOrchestrationStrategy().

Yes, in my use-case, I intend to extend WorkflowUnitOfWork to perform an interesting task (call it ExtendedUnitOfWork).  We will then directly create an instance of the workflow model using instances of WorkflowCompositeComponent and ExtendedUnitOfWork.  There may be cases when an ExtendedUnitOfWork will set the value of a WorkflowParameter that is needed by a subsequent ExtendedUnitOfWork as an input.  The connection of the output parameter to the input parameter will be explicitly modeled.  Using the name of the parameter as a key may not work as they are not guaranteed to be unique, and one ExtenedUnitOfWork is independent of the other meaning it does not care who produced the parameter value as long as it is set before execution.  It may be the case that an admin will assemble a composite from a set of existing components, and stitch the inputs and outputs using WorkflowParameterConnection.  We are also going to extend WorkflowParameter such that the value returned from the parameter is derived from the value in the WorkflowContext instead of the actual value in the WorkflowContext.

[reply] Comment 66 Bryan Hunt 2008-08-27 10:22:10 EDT I've run across an interesting design issue, and would appreciate any community feedback.  The current design parameterizes a workflow unit-of-work by storing [parameter, value] pairs in a hash map as part of the WorkflowContext.  The value is actually wrapped inside an instance of SimpleAnyType which allows it to be a primitave, or even an EMF object.  It occurred to me this morning that it might be very interesting if the workflow parameters could map to attributes / references in an arbitrary EMF model.  So instead of storing [parameter, value] pairs, the WorkflowContext would have a reference to an arbitrary EMF model, and the parameters would have a reference to maybe an EStructuralFeature (not exactly sure about the implementation here).  The parameter values would then be extracted using the EMF reflective API.  Should this new idea replace the existing WorkflowContext design, or should the design be more generic to allow for both?  I tend to favor the more generic design, but it's not currently obvious how to do the implementation.  It's also not obvious how I would extract a value from a Map, or even if this would be necessary.  It could be that the parameter points to the map itself, and you would have to extend the parameter to understand how to extract a value from the Map.  Your comments and suggestions are appreciated.

Configuring a workflow component with a *typed* complex value (instead of just passing in simple strings, objects etc.) is what I mean when I was talking of depenency injection.  IMHO such a feature is vital.  If you're still concentrating on designing a runtime model you don't have to care about this, as it is handled by the DI-language. just declare an EReference and you're done.  > > Should this new idea replace the existing WorkflowContext design, or should the > design be more generic to allow for both?  Isn't the context about passing dynamic state from component to component where the configuration of components is a static thing? I think we need both.    [reply] Comment 68 Hallvard Traetteberg 2008-09-01 07:07:59 EDT (In reply to comment #66) > I've run across an interesting design issue  If I've understood you correctly, it's similar to a problem I have. In fact, my model in many respects is a process model, although the domain is user interface domain dialog.  In this domain, the data type of a value is often tied to the type of another value, e.g. a list shows data of type T* (or whatever indicates multiple values), while the selection is of type T. It's not only value types that are related, but also return and parameter values of functions.  Initially, my solution was to add parameters to my process-like dialog element class, as key/value pairs, and a special parameter-reference EClass, that may be used as the value of EReferences representing types. I was uncomfortable with this design, for several reasons: - For the modeller, the option of inserting a type parameter was the non-typical case, and it resulted in a confusing user interface. - When parameterizing the a model fragment, it was more natural to say that this part here actually is the same as this other part, instead of introducing a parameter and saying that both these are actually this parameter. - I wanted dialogs to always be complete, and hence wanted to force the modeller to always fill in all parameters. In some sense, filling in a parameter is something that is done afterwards if the default doesn't suit you, and shouldn't be forced upon the user. - Resolving the parameter-reference increased the complexity.  The solution I'm now considering is as follows: - Instead of pointing from the point of usage (ParameterReference) to the defintion (Parameter) I only point from the definition to the point of usage (list of ParameterUsage objects, with a ""path"" from the container to the point of usage). - Instantiating a parameter involves pointing the definition to the (new) value and patching the point of usage to refer to this new value. In case of containment, the latter my involve copying structure.  This scheme is simpler because it does not require modifications to the model where the parameter is used. It is more generic since it essentially describes how structures are shared, without being tied to a particular meta-model. However, it is more complex for the person defining a parameter, since she must have a better understanding of the meta-model. However, it should be possible to semi-automatically create the ParameterUsage objects, based on searches in the containment tree.

I agree, and this is what I was attempting to do by using SimpleAnyType not realizing that it seems to limit you to an EDataType which rules out complex types.  Although SimpleAnyType extends AnyType which should allow complex types, but I didn't understand AnyType when I looked at it.  If anyone has a pointer to an example of using AnyType, that would be appreciated.  > > Isn't the context about passing dynamic state from component to component where > the configuration of components is a static thing? > I think we need both. >  The context is for passing dynamic state from component to component, and for dynamically configuring components at runtime.  The idea is that a user selects / edits a context that supplies all of the necessary parameter values to the components of a previously modeled workflow.  The current design of the WorkflowContext only allows for mapping parameters to EDataType values - meaning simple types.  I think we both agree that parameter values should be allowed to be typed complex values (EObject).  So it seems that parameters should be typed on EClassifier.  Example:  public class WorkflowParameter { private EClassifier type; private String name; private String description;  public void setType(EClassifier type)  public Object getValue(WorkflowContext context) }  My comment #66 takes this idea a step further.  What if the user's data was an instance of an EMF model, and the parameters mapped to an EStructuralFeature of that model.  I was thinking this would be a better way to model the parameters, but it seems there are problems with this design as well.  Using EStructuralFeature, you still need to map the instance of the object to the parameter so that it knows which object to get the value from using eGet().  So, right now, I don't see the advantage of this design over the current design assuming I can figure out how to use AnyType.

If the WorkflowContext maps parameters to EObject, then as you indicate, SimpleAnyType can be used to wrap simple types for storage in the map.  I think this also solves the other problems as well.  I think it's a simple matter of extending WorkflowParameter to know if it's pointing to a SimpleAnyType, complex EObject, or or an EClassifier of an EObject.  It's simple, elegant, and I like it.

I must admit that I didn't fully understand > your description of your solution.  I'll try again. In my previous model, I had a Type interface and specific Type implementations, e.g. ClassType, ListType, including a TypeParameterReference class. The latter could be used to refer by name to a TypeParameter (and its value) of a containing EObject. Code that traversed structures containing the Type objects would need to detect TypeParameterReference and lookup the real TypeParameter value.  The advantage of such parameters in general, is that there is a single place (the TypeParameter's value) to change the value of several references (the value denoted by the TypeParameterReference). In my case, the abstract description of a listbox would contain a TypeParameter T and two references List<T> and T, for the output and input types of the listbox. By setting T to a specific value, like String, you would get a listbox specific for Strings.  There are several disadvantages to this approach, in particular that code everywhere needed to be aware of the mechanism and that it was cumbersome to extend it to other type than Type.  The alternative approach (which I tried to explain) is to discard the TypeReference class, and instead extend the TypeParameter objects to include a list of ""paths"" to every place where there used be a TypeReference. So, when the TypeParameter's value is changed, it may patch the contained structure to refer directly to the new value. In the example, the listbox would be modeled by List<Object> and Object, for output and input, respectively, with no reference to the TypeParameter. The TypeParameter object would include enough information to locate the references to Object inside the structure and when the TypeParameter's value is set to String, it would replace Object with String.  In general, the TypeParameter needs to be able to navigate to all the relevant contained EObjects and the EStructuralFeature that needs to be set (a bit similar to how an EMF XMI resource uses id fragments, by the way). It shouldn't be too difficult to make TypeParameter lookup its value in other structures and react to changes at this other location.

Select Keyboard Focus tracking and the top-level frame of the FF window in the Explorer View.  Select all events to watch in the event monitor except EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE, EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROY, EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW, and EVENT_OBJECT_HIDE.  Start capture of events.  Now, proceed as follows and note the problems:  1. Switch to the FF window and tab to the first button, Create. No EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS occurs in the event monitor. Also, an alert appears with a tooltip but there is no SYSTEM_ALERT event. This event seems to be missing entirely from the events list. There are IA2_EVENT_TEXT_REMOVED and IA2_EVENT_TEXT_INSERTED events on objects with role 'alert' but not sure if there should be an aditional SYSTEM_ALERT event. Check with Pete. 2. Tab to the next button, the button that serves as a drop-down menu. Again, there is no EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS and the last event I see in the monitor is an IA2_EVENT_TEXT_CARET_MOVED on an object with role 'section'. 3. Press the button. The popup menu appears. Notice that, in the event monitor, there is an IA2_EVENT_TEXT_CARET_MOVED on the Cut menuitem and then we get the EVENT_SYSTEM_MENUPOPUPSTART event. Check with Pete, but this seems wrong to me; the events should be reversed. In any case see bug on dynamic refresh since there is currently no way to display such menuitems in the explorer.  You'll want to play with this example and others in this suite much more thoroughly to discover waht other problems we ahve. Of course, the trick is to distinguish bugs in AccProbe from those in FF.

This is misleading since property values may be seen as empty strings or as null values when, in fact, theHRESULT was S_FALSE, E_NOIMPL, or some other code that indicates that the method that accesses the property is not implemented or that the value is invalid.  These sorts of values sould be displayed in the properties view.  Our strategy for dealing with HRESULT values!= S_OK will be as follows: 1. Define a new protected field, Map errorCodeReturnMap =- new HashMap() in org.eclipse.actf.accservice.win32.msaa.MsaaAccessible and a public method for retreaving it, errorCodeMap(). (Don't make it a getter else PropertyUtils.describe will include it.) 2. You'll populate this map from the native code. Each time you get a value != S_OK, retreave the map with the public method and the handle you get to the accessible object of which it is a member and place the property name (i.e. method name without 'get' and with first char to lower case) or the method name (if it's not a getter) in the map as the key and the error as the value for that key. The error should be a string, which will make (3) easier. Obviously, the retreval of a map for a given accessible object and the put to that map can be static.  I recommend something like:  void putErrorCode(jobject acc, string key, HRESULT errorCode)  I also recommend a public constant like '*** ERROR ***' to indicate that the value that does appear in the properties view is not a legitimate value of a property.  Thus, you might see something like:  accessibleDescription | *** ERROR *** S_FALSE  3. In AccProbe's Properties View, you can simply ""dump"" the error code map into the map you create for actual return values. For keys that exist in the errorCodeReturnMap, those keys will overwrite keys and values in the actual return value map returned by describe and the other techniques employed to populate the view that you are working on.

The problem is that there are too many methods for some classes and interfaces when both the declared methods of the class or interface and all of the methods of the super-classes or super-interfaces of that class are listed.  The current functionality also requires the user to continually input the method parameters even if those parameters do not change.  We'll do the following to enhance functionality: 1. for the value types that are not primitives or strings, display the declared  methods of that value type as subnodes of the property. Display the non-declared methods of that value type in the dialog. 2. Since the non-getter methods will require parameters, all non-accessor methods will have their name displayed as the property and a dummy string such as '<Click to enter parameters>' as their value.  When double-clicked, a dialog for entering the appropriate number of parameters will be displayed and the entered parameters will be cached for future instances of this method invocation. The parameters will be cached so long as the accessible object from which the properties in the properties view are derived is not changed and so long as the user does not double-click the property/method name again to enter new values.  Comment 1 Kavitha Teegala 2008-04-28 18:04:09 EDT 1) Added selection Listener to prorpeties view to bring up methodInvocation Dialog when the treeItem contains the value '<Click to enter parameters>'. Will pass in the method name to be invoked 2)Modified methodInvocationDialog constructor to take in an additional method field. The method comboBox will only contain one method, the one passed in from preoprties view. Simplified the method names to be short. 3)Added to list the type of parameters besides the parameters fields.(such as int)  The rest of the functionality is similar to 'Invoke method'.  One issue I'm seeing is that when I click on one of these propeties (which take parameters) for the first time, I'm seeing two dialog boxes to popup as two selection events are being fired.

[reply] Comment 2 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-05 11:09:21 EDT Created attachment 98643 [details] Patch for this bug  After executing the commands there are both IRemoteOutput and IRemoteError (from the ""ls"" command) objects in the selection. The context menu is built by calling each adapter (SystemViewRemoteOutputAdapter, SystemViewRemoteErrorAdapter) to add actions in the menu. SystemViewRemoteErrorAdapter#addActions is implemented to always call its super which is wrong in the case when we have both RemoteOutput and RemoteError objects and leads to adding the Copy twice. In the proposed patch the selection is checked if it contains only RemoteError objects and only then it adds the content menu actions.  [reply] Comment 3 Martin Oberhuber 2008-05-05 20:05:21 EDT Ok, I see -- in case there is a multi-select which contains only RemoteError objects, the RemoteError action(s) will be added. The RemoteOutput adapter will not be asked in this case.  When the multi-select contains any one element that is not a RemoteError, the RemoteError action(s) will not be added.  This sounds fair enough for me, since in many cases a non-homogeneous multiselect will limit the list of available actions, Project Explorer also does it that way.  Please apply the patch, DaveM please review after the fact if you find any issue with it. When verifying the fix, we should make sure that in case of running a compile command like gcc foo.c on the remote, we can still jump to the location of a compile error properly.  I find the issue itself trivial, since it is only exposed in case of multiselect, and it is harmless.  [reply] Comment 4 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-06 05:43:32 EDT Patch committed.

Oberhuber 2008-05-02 10:27:37 EDT This is most likely an adapter loading issue due to bug 218304. Thanks for reporting this!  This can only happen when rse.shells.ui (or rse.files.ui) is not yet loaded when you perform the content assist. That is, it must happen very soon after Eclipse startup.  Can you please give exact steps you take for connecting your subsystem (I assume you use ""Launch Shell""). We will need to place a  Platform.getAdapterManager().loadAdapter()  call in the proper place of RemoteShellSubsystem.initializeSubSystem() or similar, to force the adapter loading at the right time. Similar to RemoteFileSubSystem.initializeSubSystem().  Could you try to fix it yourself? - I can help out if you think you can't handle it.  [reply] Comment 2 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-02 10:58:44 EDT Martin, you are correct, this happens only if org.eclipse.rse.files.ui is not activated. If I explicitly start this plug-in from the Plug-In Registry view or expand Local Files, the content assist is working fine.  So, the problem is reproduced with Local Shells every time when Local Files is not expanded (org.eclipse.rse.files.ui is not activated).  There is a call to loadAdapter in RemoteCmdSubSystem#initializeSubSystem(): // load UI plugin for adapters right after successful connect Platform.getAdapterManager().loadAdapter(new RemoteOutput(null, """"), ""org.eclipse.rse.ui.view.ISystemViewElementAdapter"");  It seems that we need also to bring up something else.  [reply] Comment 3 Martin Oberhuber 2008-05-02 11:22:14 EDT Ah, ok. I'm pretty sure that this happens on ""local"" only and not on ssh or dstore -- because local is special, it is ""always connected"".  Because it is always connected, the connect() calls are never activated and therefore the file adapters are only loaded when expanding the RSE tree. This is apparently not sufficient for the collaboration between shells and files.  This is a little bit tricky to solve, because we do not want to create unwanted dependencies shells->files or files->shells.  I think the right algorithm is probably this: In the SubSystem#resolveFilterString() methods [3 occurrences] change this code:  if (!supportsConnecting && !_isInitialized) { // Lazy Loading: Load adapters (e.g. Local Subsystem) initializeSubSystem(monitor); }  into initializing all subsystems that share the same connector service:  // Lazy Loading: Load adapters (e.g. Local Subsystem) if (!_isInitialized) { ISubSystem[] ss = getHost().getSubSystems(); for (int i=0; i<ss.length; i++) { if (!ss[i].getSubSystemConfiguration().supportsSubSystemConnect()) { ss[i].initializeSubSystem(new NullProgressMonitor()); } } }  The code needs to be more polished, e.g. put into a separate private method to re-use, and use the _isInitialized variable in order to avoid doing the initialization multiple times. But with this basic idea, in case a subsystem does not support the connect, we ensure that all subsystems that share a host get initialized even if they do not run a specific connect call.  [reply] Comment 4 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-03 03:36:40 EDT Thanks for explaining the problem, I will try to come up with a patch soon in order to get the fix into M7.  [reply] Comment 5 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-04 11:16:14 EDT Created attachment 98562 [details] Patch for this bug  SubSystem#resolveFilterString() methods are not called when content assist action is performed. We could check for adapter==null in CommandEntryContentAssistProcessor#getImageFor and load the adapters but this is potentially slow operation and may slow down the CA action. So, my proposal is to place the loadAdapter() call in ShellServiceSubSystem#internalRunShell which is spawned as a job when the user select ""Launch Shell"".  [reply] Comment 6 Martin Oberhuber 2008-05-05 20:13:25 EDT Hm... loading adapters in the internalRunShell() method is a good idea, but I'm not sure if it actually helps loading the shells.ui adapters here? - My understanding was that the files.ui adapters were missing and led to the NPE, no?  This seems to work currently, because shells.ui has a dependency on files.ui in its MANIFEST.MF, but I'd actually like to get rid of this dependency, see also bug  227535 for the terminal, a similar approach should be there for the shells. It's just not logical that shells.ui depends on files.ui.  I still think that the following is more correct: * At the time a shell (or remote command) is launched, the connectorService will be connected * All subsystems that share the same connectorService (and thus get connected) should be initialized * When initializing a subsystem, UI adapters should be loaded.  Essentially, internalRunShell() is the counterpart to resolveFilterString() in files.ui, it needs to start subsystem initialization, and needs to do so for itself as well as all other subsystems on the same connector service.  [reply] Comment 7 Martin Oberhuber 2008-05-05 20:16:00 EDT The other option is living with a slight delay on the content assist, and putting a Platform.getAdapterManager().loadAdapter() call into the method that NPE's because of the missing adapter.  I'm also OK with that solution, at least for now, since the content assist takes a little time anyways, and with the lazy loadAdapter() we get the smallest number of plugins activated.

[reply] Comment 9 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-06 06:45:10 EDT Created attachment 98788 [details] Patch for this bug  Loading the adapters before the NPE is thrown. It turns out that it doesn't slow down a lot the CA action and the patch is simple enough to be included in M7. For the long turn we should consider Martin's algorithm for loading adapters in comment 6. Martin, please review, I am waiting your approval to commit the patch.  [reply] Comment 10 Martin Oberhuber 2008-05-06 07:00:55 EDT (In reply to comment #8) > I am loading files.ui adapters by requesting an adapter for RemoteFileEmpty. > Why do you think I am trying to load shells.ui adapters? Or I am missing  Sorry. Must have been too late for me yesterday. You're right of course.  New patch looks good though I think it can be simplified since we usually don't want really want the RemoteFileEmpty adapter:  // load org.eclipse.rse.files.ui for adapters in order to be able // to perform ""content assist"" in a local shell, see bug#229956  ISystemViewElementAdapter adapter = (ISystemViewElementAdapter) ((IAdaptable) object).getAdapter(ISystemViewElementAdapter.class); if (adapter == null) { adapter = (ISystemViewElementAdapter) Platform.getAdapterManager().loadAdapter( object, ISystemViewElementAdapter.class.getName()); } descriptor = adapter.getImageDescriptor(object);   When applying this version of the patch, please check the ""RemoteOutput"" part of your command view after typing ls, pwd and similar commands, whether all operations are possible. It could be that the RemoteOutput also needs some IRemoteFile adapters to display some icons.  On 2nd consideration, your initial patch in launchShell() is perhaps the safer solution, although I'm not overjoyed with it because it does load files.ui a little bit too eagerly (there might be cases where content assist is never used, then files.ui would not be needed). Also, in case a non-UI headless application wants to launch a Shell, it won't ever need any UI so loading the adapters is not adequate in that case.  On the other hand, thanks to lazy adapter loading it's still better than what we had in 2.0 and loading adapters eagerly in launchShell is the safest we can do for now. We can still revise the change later to improve the UI / non-UI story. For now, it's important to stabilize and get the issue fixed.  I'm OK with applying any of your two patches, and revising the situation later when we get rid of the shells.ui --> files.ui dependency (and also shells.core --> files.core if we can). Could you check if there is already a bug for this dependency and create one if not?  [reply] Comment 11 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-05-06 07:30:46 EDT I committed your version of the patch, I will revise the adapter loading stuff after M7. The remote commands are working fine.

[reply] Comment 10 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-11-06 11:13:15 EST Created attachment 117218 [details] patch for this bug  The problem occurs when you try to copy files from one host to another. It is two-step process: 1) the files are downloaded from the source host to the workspace 2) the files are uploaded to the destination host from the workspace If you hit ""cancel"" during the first operation, an error message is shown and NPE is thrown. The proposed patch adds catch clause for SystemOperationCancelledException in downloadFileToWorkspace() in order to prevent showing an error and it makes additional checks on the progress monitor for terminating the whole operation if it is canceled by the user. Note that if there are some downloaded files before the operation is canceled, they are simply discarded because step 2) is skipped. If this behaviour is ok, the patch sould be fine.  [reply] Comment 11 Radoslav Gerganov 2008-11-26 09:06:28 EST Updating the target milestone to 3.1M4 I need someone to review the patch or at least share some thoughts about.

Here are a few additional comments. Nothing major. Looks great. Simple and to the point.  --Fitz  Topic: Creating a Database Connection Profile Step 2: Please note that the search is case-insensitive now (from RC1 on). And also note that you will be able to (from RC1 on) type a sub-string like ""JDBC"" or ""embedded"" to filter the list.  Step 5: (Just a thanks for removing the Fast Driver button and a quick note to others that this button has gone away and may reappear in a future release after some serious rethinking of design.)  Topic: Renaming a Connection Profile  Prerequisites: Please remove the ""Sybase recommends"" and replace it with ""It is recommended that you disconnect from the server before renaming the connection profile."" This should be done in all cases where the ""Sybase recommends"" string appears.  Topic: Deleting a Connection Profile  Same note about prerequisites  Topic: Editing a Driver Definition  Might want to note that users can also edit a driver definition selected for a given connection profile by clicking the triangle (edit) button beside the drivers drop-down list on the profile property page.  [reply] Comment 5 Linda Chan 2008-05-15 22:22:34 EDT It looks good, thanks Emily. Just a couple of minor comments:  Topic: Exporting a Connection Profile  There are additional use cases for exporting a connection profile, besides porting to another workspace.  It would be good to mention that too.  The export feature is also good for deploying a set of connection profiles to a backend server environment, whose application can work directly with the exported file.  The exported file can simply be copied to a server, and no need to explicitly import them.  Topic: Editing Connection Profile Properties  Is the scope of this description limited to the DSE? Just want to mention that we now have a console editor application that can be used to view and edit connection profile properties.  It would be nice if we can mention its availability somewhere in the doc. For reference, the simple instructions on how to use the profile console editor is attached in bug 225866: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=100358.  [reply] Comment 6 Emily Kapner 2008-05-20 17:17:42 EDT Incorporated review comments. Added a new topic called Console Editor Application. Resolving BZ as fixed.

This way one could implement any functionality which is not provided by RAPI and invoke it using this API. Speaking about RSE, this will enable the implementation of processes subsystem for WinCE because there are no APIs for process management in the standard RAPI. So we could implement a WinCE DLL having routines for listing the processes, terminating a process, etc., provision this DLL on the device and invoke it's routines via CeRapiInvoke. What do you think about this concept? I have almost complete implentation which works on variety of devices and I would like to submit it for review.

Looks like you'll need some bootstrapping (copy the helper dll to the device), which can happen manually outside Eclipse or inside RSE. Manually is safer, inside Eclipse is more convenient.  I guess my main concern is that in case the helper DLL is not 100% compatible with a particular device, executing such native code could potentially break the device. Any ideas how to avoid this? My only idea now is to force user to manually install the helper DLL on the device, so it is clear to the user that he is acting on his own responsibility.  RSE could then detect availability of the helper dll, and if it's needed for some functionality but not there, then instruct the user how to install it on the device (perhaps some setup wizard could guide the user in installation, perhaps even copy it to the device, associated with some text that explains potential issues).  [reply] Comment 2 Martin Oberhuber 2008-06-27 08:21:01 EDT Also, consider versioning issues:  Assume that RSE 3.0.1 has installed helper.dll on the remote, then RSE 3.4 (for instance) tries to call stuff with CeRapiInvoke ... correct version of the helper dll on the remote must be checked.  I suggest implementing ONE function like getDllVersion() in the helper DLL, calling this function can then act for detecting availability of the DLL on the remote as well as correct version. Version numbering scheme should be like in Eclipse (major.minor.service.qualifier).

Note that we may want to provide CAB file containing the DLL for installation on the device because this way we can also satisfy the security requirements for some of the devices (see the last part of Remarks section in MSDN).  > I guess my main concern is that in case the helper DLL is not 100% compatible > with a particular device, executing such native code could potentially break > the device.

What do you mean by ""not 100% compatible""? Even if these API are not available on some device for some reasons we are not going break anything, it just won't work. I agree that the user will be responsible for his actions, that's why I prefer the manual install of the helper dll.  > RSE could then detect availability of the helper dll, and if it's needed for > some functionality but not there, then instruct the user how to install it on > the device (perhaps some setup wizard could guide the user in installation, > perhaps even copy it to the device, associated with some text that explains > potential issues). > Yes, this could be part of the connection wizard for WinCE which needs to be changed anyway (bug 231431). For now I think that downloading the DLL/CAB from the TM site and installing it manually will be OK.  (In reply to comment #2) > Also, consider versioning issues:  Good point, I like the idea of having getDllVersion() to solve this.

[reply] Comment 5 Martin Oberhuber 2008-06-30 05:03:07 EDT I reviewed your code and it looks good overall. The separation between CeRapiInvoke (for running) and CeRapiInvokeEx (for getting output data) seems a little bit odd, but I assume that this is required by how the RAPI works.  In CeRapiInvoke(), is it ok to env->ReleaseIntArrayElements when the int array is really meant as an output parameter (returning the size and pointer to output data, if I'm not mistaken)?

When you call GetIntArrayElements the JNI will either ""pin"" down the array or it will make a copy of it into a nonmovable memory. ReleaseIntArrayElements respectively ""unpin"" the array or copies back the content.  [reply] Comment 7 Martin Oberhuber 2008-06-30 05:49:01 EDT Well, fine then, let's go for it. Note that the version of the RAPI plugin must be incremented from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 since this is a compatible API change -- I can do that for you once the stuff is committed, since getting all the feature versions right can be a bit tricky.  Since WinCE and RAPI are still in Incubation, I have no problem with doing an API addition in the TM 3.0.x maintenance Stream. Adopters who are writing code against the RAPI Lib know that it's in incubation so they are prepared for ongoing changes. But we should discuss this at the Wednesday TM meeting.

[reply] Comment 4 Weiping Lu 2008-08-18 13:45:01 EDT Gumin, you are right, this is not related to 244229, even though it's a sort issue in xsl. The patch has been applied.

Kavitha - pls report on each of these (i.e. whether fixed, invalid, etc.)  1. When clicking on text in the client area,  Symphony fires a focus event but the properties and explorer panes don't respond.  (Obviously, this is for app-by-app tracking but would still like the text widget to get shown in the Explorer View and, even better, the sub-element that has actual caret focus.) Also, the event log should log the IA2 role (paragraph), not the MSAA role (client). (I assume that all of this is noted after simply entering some initial text in the text editor.) 2. Problems related to hyperlinks: a) Neither caret tracking nor focus tracking are working.   This is when I click on text in a paragraph.  My paragraph is:  text, a link, text. (We also need a general update on caret tracking for both global and app-by-app modes.) b. After spending about an hour I finally found the paragraph object.  Only hyperlinkCount is displayed.  I had to use invoke to execute hyperlinkIndex.  I hope you can get rid of invoke. c. I can't tell what the HRESULT is from that invoked method.  It just shows getHyperlinkIndex(0) = 0  This does not include naming issues related to bug 238660  [reply] Comment 1 Kavitha Teegala 2008-08-11 12:10:54 EDT 1. App-by-app tracking does not work with Symphony at this point, hence the explorer view is not being updated, but property view does get updated for every focus,mouse and caret events in global tracking mode. Event log does seem to be showing only msaa roles for symphony. Will look into this.  2a. Fixed (caret tracking works in global mode) 2b. Fixed (Accprobe 0.4.1 allows user to input parameters,no need to use invoke) 2c. HRESULT values are available only for MsaaAccessible and IA2Accessible at this point.

But theoretically, it's possible.  The patch seems ok. But I think it needs to consider synchronization issue.  Suppose below scenario:  .... <1>  if (!isDisposed()) { <2>	editor.execute(script); } ...  1. thread 1 execute <1> and isDisposed() return false 2. thread 2 disposes the editor 3. now thread 1 shouldn't execute <2>, but because there's no synchronization mechanism, thread 1 continue to execute <2>, and might still get the error exception  ========== So I think the patch might look like this:  synchronized(editor){ <1>  if (!isDisposed()) { <2>	editor.execute(script); } }  [reply] Comment 5 Alex Fitzpatrick 2008-09-12 10:11:59 EDT We are currently using 1.2.0.4 (which bugzilla will not let me specify BTW) but we are considering moving up to 1.5.  I would suggest you fix it in both if that's not a problem.  [reply] Comment 6 Alex Fitzpatrick 2008-09-12 10:37:12 EDT I don't think the synchronization is necessary as that asynch exec will always cause that code to execute in the UI thread.  However, I don't see how it could hurt either other than adding a slight overhead to each command executed on Linux.

2008-10-31 13:07:08 EDT,250489,Remove Tomcat references from documentation,"Remove Tomcat references from documentation [reply] Description David Whiteman 2008-10-10 16:34:02 EDT The documentation needs to be scrubbed of references to Tomcat, since prereqing or implying that it's a prereq, is not legally approved by Eclipse IP.  Please compile a list of Tomcat references in the docs, and work with developers to determine the appropriate wording change.  In many cases, you can refer to a ""web server that supports JSP and Servlet technology"" in lieu of Tomcat.  References to example command line invocations that include references to Tomcat, such as c:\tomcat-5-5-25, should be changed to something like c:\web-server-5-5-25 or just <web-server-directory>.  These changes must be done before we ship version 1.0.  [reply] Comment 1 SrinivasReddy 2008-10-14 02:13:56 EDT By removing tomcat references from all docs, how does an end user know which webserver to use and also which version to use ? So far we have tested and supporting only tomcat 5.5.2x.  I guess, atleast on COSMOS demo page we need to provide instructions with specific details of web server and it's version.  [reply] Comment 2 David Whiteman 2008-10-14 10:43:33 EDT Unfortunately we have to live by the Eclipse legal rules which are that we can't imply that Tomcat is required without getting approval to do so in IPZilla.  So that would be something we would want to target for the future.  But in the near term we should remove any references to Tomcat in the docs or Wiki, since we need to be in good shape with that for our release review.  Please bring this issue up at the comm call tomorrow if you want to discuss this directly with Ruth.

Please > advise on what you'd like me to do.  I was trying to appeal to your tech writing experience whether you thought it was better to have the info in both places or to reduce places we have to maintain.  Given that you will be off the project soon, and we are limited in resources, we should probably err on the latter side (just referring people to the install guide in this case).  Make sure the install guide mentions both configDemo.bat and configDemo.sh (can't remember if it does).   [reply] Comment 10 Pam Kusnirik 2008-10-29 15:35:26 EDT I see what you mean. Well, I hate to remove the section because if I did, the entire chapter would be just a referral, since we're referring them to the Install Guide for installing COSMOS, which is the only other section. I think I'll leave the page in the User's Guide if that's ok with you. I'm attaching the two related pages from the User and Install Guide, with your edits.

That doesn't make sense.  See my earlier comment on that.  Instead of ""In this example, COSMOS web applications are installed on a Tomcat web server"", I would say ""Using the configDemo scripts, the COSMOS web applications are installed on a Tomcat web server.  For a different web server, you can modify the scripts, or copy the files manually to the correct locations.""  ======  Install guide:  Change ""<tomcatDir: Apache Tomcat install directory>: Tomcat install directory"" to ""tomcatDir: Apache Tomcat install directory"".  No need for the <> and the description is redundant.  Make tomcatDir bold like the other parameters.  Question for Srinivas or Hubert... is this correct: ""axis2war: (optional) Path to the Axis2 JAR files.""  Since the argument has ""war"" in the name, is it really the location of the JAR files (""lib"") or are they supposed to supply the location of a war file (which we do not prereq)?

Hence I feel axis2war argument is required here.  Probably we can add a note saying, after axis2 installed into tomcat, customize axis2 lib to include only COSMOS approved axis2 jar files.

We should instead say ""path to > Axis2 war file"" or something like that, right?  If Axis2War is required for the first time, shouldn't that be noted in the Prereqs page? There are three downloads available on the Apache page - http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download/1_3/download.cgi - (which we aren't citing) and I was under the impression all the jar files were in the Source Distr. download.

[marius] we need something capable to store binary data (blobs). Also RDBMS are capable to do that...but we don't use anything else from it, like querying. RDBMSs have been built based on central server architectures. Also, the RDBMSs typically limit all processing to the SQL language and its operations (SELECT/PROJECT/JOIN and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). ODBMSs simply use the object language to create and access objects.... so, in conclusion we may also use RDBMS if required  > > hierarchical structure > i guess what u described here is a B-Tree algorithm if i understood it > correctly. i suppose u should be able to find sources and maybe even > implementations on that on the internet but i haven't checked that.  [marius] basically b-trees are fundamental data structure used to construct other data (more abstract) structures with the major advantage of binary search, sorting or traversing. Through this hierarchic structure I did not refer to a b-tree. Also,in this hierarchic structure I don't use the parent - child terms (relation, nodes) to determine a record (leaf).  > as to the storing of the mapping: i dont think that this is needed when u > deterministically calculate the node position from the ID.  [marius] yes, right. This is also possible. but this is very dependent on the hash algorithm...I just indexed 21.000 files and took a look into the binary storage. The records naming is different starting with the 2nd or the 3rd char. i.e. faa8d9d1f71e5f3a1b7d8a557e36f12546cc7556eccdbbf517cb1b0206d, fa45682267968e0066a9ac89fb8ce3b49b8e48585b7cca886e7484f3b9 Of course, we can deterministically calculate a node position (path) but it may be that we end up with lot of records in the same folder (path) like current impl.  > > concurrent access/cluster > i would, if possible, delegate this to the underlying implementation. > clustering is similar to the XmlStorage, where BDB supports clustering under a > write-master/slave readers scenario which might be a good choice here too. in > that case we should make that choice/re-election of a new master instance in a > distributed scenario transparent to any client.

[marius] Also, currently the only client of Binary Storage Service (BSS) is the blackboard - which generates the id (hashed) by itself. In case that the BSS shall deterministically calculate the node position from the ID, BSS shall generate by itself the hashed-IDs to be used in deterministically calculation, even for IDs passed from blackboard.  blackboard (generates ID) ---> call BSS  --> BSS (generates hashed ID &process)  client component(uses some key)  ---> call BSS  --> BSS (generates hashed ID &process)   [reply] Comment 4 Daniel Stucky 2008-10-22 04:34:21 EDT Some more comments.  - Hierarchical structure: Igor has had the idea to make use of the fact that the key is a hash-key. Instead of complex computing the node position on could use the hashkey to create the path to the node, by splitting it in N parts und use the hash-key itself as filename. E.g. heash-key is ""faa8d9d1f71e"" then the path could be fa/a8/d9/d1/f7/1e/faa8d9d1f71e. The distribution then depends on the randomness of the hash algorithm used to create the key. This could be a simple alternative. A drawback I see is, that one cannot enforce that the key parameter is a reasonable hash (e.g. when used by other developers.  - Object DataBase: I agree with Tom that RDBMS should be supported, too  - Cluster configuration: Is there a need the set flat/hierachical structure on top of a DFS? Doesn't a DFS decide by itself where it stores it's files ?  - Technical aspects: please don't restrict to Commons VSF only. At the moment we have massive memory problems using VFS.

[marius] this may be a solution also. but just imagine that for each record BSS will create 6 folders and it is very possible to have a matching name only for the first two or three folder names (like fa/a8).  > - Object DataBase: I agree with Tom that RDBMS should be supported, too  [marius] good.

[reply] Comment 9 Marius Cimpean 2008-10-28 06:40:59 EDT The Binary Storage Service will not extend the commons-vfs to provide all concrete implementations (like RDBMS or ODBMS). Main reasons would be: - not make our BSS implementation dependent on the commons-vfs. - commons-vfs is a strictly file-system API. To extend the commons-vfs for other implementation, like RDBMS we should take care of some technical considerations (specific for RDBMS - like transactions & ACID operations & isolations level ...) which are not supported by commons-vfs; - in case we will switch from commons-vfs to another API, the we will have to move our extensions too.  [reply] Comment 10 thomas menzel 2008-10-29 04:44:59 EDT all VFS and its implementation related details/problems should be discussed now @ bug 252353. thus, this bug is more concerned about the conceptual aspects of the binstorage.  question in regard to configurable tree: how, or more precisely WHERE do u intend to safe the mapping information? it cant be in memory due to the possible amount of files!  i also dont like the idea of saving mapping data conceptually. i understand that a B-Tree will cause some overhead in calculating the deterministic path and also when it needs to reorganize the nodes to fit it's configuration but i think this is not such a big problem if the node sizes have a fairly large range, e.g. 256..512.  besides, moving files in a local file system isnt that costly. when dealing with distributed storage (in the sense if FTP) one needs to become careful though to avoid moving files between nodes, especially when managing different storage nodes in the cluster as part of the B-TREE . This also applies to the local FS when it spans different partitions.

I used a different approach to select the right window in Explorer View because using focus to get active window will not always work, especially with mouse cursor tracking. The processId of the accessible object being tracked is compared  with the pid of the selected object in the explorer view. If it's not the same, all the top level windows are scanned for their Pid's and the matching window will be selected and then expanded to show the accessible object.

2009-06-19 08:27:20 EDT,252353,[Bin Storage] Implementation :: VFS vs. EFS,"[Bin Storage] Implementation :: VFS vs. EFS [reply] Description thomas menzel 2008-10-28 09:28:33 EDT Due to some bugs in VFS there has been a notion of maybe replacing this with another implementation, e.g. EFS which fulfills a similar use case.  This bug shall serve as a collector for por and cons to get to come to the decision for choosing one over the other.  here are some resources on the subject: --------------------------------------- http://eclipsezone.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=92063570 read the comments for more insight !! http://eclipsezone.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=92063570#92063570  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=106176 look for comments containing VFS to see why they dont use it note worthy: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=106176#c20 on the semantic diff. of FileSystem in VFS and EFS  problem with VFS: ------------------ VFS offers internal support for caching. to this extend it maintains two large maps: one holds (as far as we know so far) the cached binary data while the other holds a map for the listeners to all objects in the files system. listeners are needed to keep the cache in sync in case a 3rd party changes the files in the underlying filesystem and hence all items starting from a node in the plugined in filesystem seem to have a listner.  while it seems that items in the cache can be removed to free up memory (depends on cache strategy) this doesnt seem to be true for the listeners. this is possible a bug but maybe also by design, but marius is looking into that and possible find a way to patch.  in case this is by design, VFS cannot be used for SMILA b/c of the use case to store millions of items in BinStorage which will in that case not be possible due to memory constraints.  [reply] Comment 1 Juergen Schumacher 2008-10-28 12:00:15 EDT I've not yet read the resources about EFS (will do it tomorrow), but in my opinion at least for the initial SMILA version there is a simple third alternative: Do not use any abstract filesystem at all, but implement a simple binstorage that just support (java.io.)Files. We can do a binstorage implentation (or adapt the first version) based on an abstract file system later when we know better about the pros and contras of different implementations. Or is there an advantage of using an abstract filesystem implementation when we currently use only a ""real"" filesystem for the binary data anyway?  [reply] Comment 2 Marius Cimpean 2008-10-28 12:19:19 EDT Related to EFS - the only thing I am worried about is the old thread/messages list. The community posts are little old (2005, 2006) . Anyway, just in case it will be necessary, research will give us better results related to EFS.  Advantage of using an abstract file system implementation is related to distributed file system (ftp,sftp) - which we will need to use it in next future.  [reply] Comment 3 thomas menzel 2008-10-29 04:12:06 EDT >  the only thing I am worried about is the old thread/messages list. i wouldnt worry about old community posts for EFS b/c it is a working building block in eclipse. so it has support and it seems to work.  > Do not use any abstract filesystem at all, shure, that is always possible. dont see a problem though currently in regard to timeframe  [reply] Comment 4 Marius Cimpean 2008-10-29 05:03:41 EDT (In reply to comment #3) > >  the only thing I am worried about is the old thread/messages list. > i wouldnt worry about old community posts for EFS b/c it is a working building > block in eclipse. so it has support and it seems to work. [marius] as suggested, a EFS research and some tests will give use best answers.  > Do not use any abstract filesystem at all, shure, that is always possible. dont see a problem though currently in regard to timeframe [marius] I already implemented a simple way of storing binary records into the local file system (no abstract filesystem at all). This may be a solution for a period of time too,....but as soon as we need to be able to access (persist/fetch) data into distributed file system I think we will reinvent the wheal. So, for the moment I think it is very important to know if only the local file system is in our scope.  [reply] Comment 5 Juergen Schumacher 2008-10-29 07:36:58 EDT A ""local"" file system solution does not restrict us to ""physically local"" file system, we can still use shared network drives or NFS or whatever else can be treated transparently. I'm not sure how relevant something like FTP/SFTP is in this context. Actually I would be even more interested in supporting a real distributed file system (something like Hadoop DFS), but that's not the scope currently.  Regarding ""VFS vs EFS"": For a real decision we would need an evaluation of the performance of both implementations (I reckon, they both should be able to support the binstorage needs, so that should not be an issue. Or is it?). And in this context it would be interesting to see what overhead they introduced compared to using java.io.File&Co. immediately. If the overhead is significant we could use a ""local filesystem"" implementation of the BinStorage service anyway for optimal performance, and an additional xFS implementation for cases where the flexibility is important.  And in case that EFS does not have significant worse performance compared to VFS I would vote for using EFS because we are in the Eclipse community anyway, and the development of EFS seems to be more active (at least in the e4-dev-list there is also some talk about EFS) than that of VFS (apparently they do not even care about fixing memory leaks ...)  Cheers, Juergen  [reply] Comment 6 Marius Cimpean 2008-10-29 07:59:28 EDT I agree with you Juergen. I'll soon post some remarks related to VFS. I already started (and have) a java.io.* implementation for our binary storage. I will also go in parallel with some EFS research to see how it behaves.  [reply] Comment 7 Marius Cimpean 2008-10-29 08:38:06 EDT related to the VFS issues:  the two maps that holds instances which commons-vfs works with, are : - cache map - listeners map  The cache map could be earlier released, by removing the cached object after each access (unfortunately there is no way you can setup commons-vfs working without cache).  The listeners map is the main memory consumption and there is no external way (accessing the API) from the client side to deal with it  - this is how was meant to be.  Also, I posted technical questions to the commons-vfs community (forum discussions list & email) but got no answers.  At the moment, from this point of view (memory consumption) we could choose to : - drop of the commons-vfs (at least for the next period of time) and to move forward (even with our java.io implementation or something else - already mentioned in this thread) - patch the commons-vfs & support the commons-vfs project (I don't suggest this option for the moment...)  Based on these facts, it looks like we need to switch from commons-vfs to something else.  If there is anyone who strongly supports usage of commons-vfs (at least for this project phase), please post your arguments.

Can Logging with a specifc loggerclass used for this?  I think we need 5 messages 1. record with id was crawled 2. record with id send to queue xy 3. dfp reads record from queue xy 4. dfp send record to queue xy 5. lucene pipelet send record to index  [reply] Comment 1 Dmitry Hazin 2008-11-07 11:22:54 EST Creating logger for every record id won't be a good practice, because when the method LogFactory.getLog(name) is executed, it creates new Logger instance for each name and puts it into internal HashMap. Thus creating Logger for every record id will cause the great memory consumption. Possible solution can be to use the same Logger with some predefined name for all records and put id information into the log message. Log4JLogger adapter from commons logging can be extended so that it will have additional method that will get the 'records' Logger and log messages into it, so the usage will be transparent for the end user, something like _log.info(String message, Id id) or _log.info(String message, String idHash). With this solution records lifecycle information will go to separate logger without forcing user to get this separate logger each time.  [reply] Comment 2 Dmitry Hazin 2008-11-26 11:33:54 EST Logging of the record path through framework was added to the code.

(I used C:\test\accprobe\about.html) and select OK.  The full filename is entered in the Launch target entry field.  However, and error appears on the launch configuration dialog that reads "" A valid file must be specified.""  [reply] Comment 1 Ann Ford 2008-11-10 18:22:33 EST Additional information - The apply and run buttons are disabled at this point (presumably because of the error) so it appears there is no way to save your choice.  However, if you select to close, a pop-up prompts you to save your changes, and will allow you to do so.  If you then re-open the run configuration, the filename is now prefixed with ""file:/"" and the error is gone. It appears that this needs to be prepended to the string in order for it to meet the test (i.e. file:/C:/test/accprobe/about.html).  Once this is done, the validation proceeds correctly.

There are the issues I fixed: 1) The atrribute value for ATTR_IS_URL in launch configuartion is always set to be true ireespective of the value for isUrl. So, everytime a saved configuaration is re-opened, the path shows the local file but the URL button is selected. Also, reset the values for ATTR_PROJECT and ATTR_WEB_MODULE attributes in case of a local file. 2) Apply and run buttons are being disabled because the isValidPath() is always returning false for a local file. 3) It looks like updateWidgetEnablements() needs to be called before updateLaunchConfigurationDialog() for the Apply or Run buttons to be enabled.

Javascript code is analyzed from javascript files (MIME types application/x-javascript and text/javascript), from contents of the <script> DOM element, from href=""javascript:..."" attributes and from on<something> attributes (like onclick etc).  Flash parsing: Flash parser works for MIME-type application/x-shockwave-flash. swfutils.jar library from Adobe Flex SDK (MPL 1.1 licensed, need to recheck license information) is used for parsing SWF files. Text is extracted from text fields and initial edit text fields. Also text and urls are extracted from ActionScript 1/2 code (version 3 support is not implemented yet). Actionscript code is analyzed in the following way: 1. Urls from geturl action are added to the list of urls; 2. AS virtual machine stack is emulated to some extent to separate variable and function names in the disassembled code from text assignments. Text assignments are analyzed for being urls (with regexp). Text assignments from setMember action are added to the list of extracted text strings.  Need to discuss: 1. Probably parsing of different content types should be done with ProcessingServices rather than by webcrawler itself? 2. The way how extracted text should be returned. Currently text is returned as byte[] which should be html but it won't work for flash content.

I think you can create a small flash, that contains the basic things, that you extract, or you can try to analyze official swfs from known pages (adobe?).  Regarding the Version support, i think we should support also the last version, thus please implement at least basic support for v3.

[reply] Comment 8 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-26 04:48:21 EST I'wasnt aware that it is possible to send the whole configuration.  regarding remoting: we have the same problem for indexorders.

[reply] Comment 9 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-27 09:23:51 EST Regarding the DataDictionary Configuration (see Discussion at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=262520)   Perhaps we could create two separate examples, the usage of the filesystemcrawler and the usage with ACLs that means we need a special indexorderconfiguration (that have attributes to collect also acls) we need also a second datadictionaryconfiguration (that would fit to the idea to create_thread management commando with the parameters file (and the file contains the datadictionaryinformation). We should have this also for the test_index  maybe the pipelet can also search for a datadictionaryconfiguration file if it should add records to an index that doesnt exist at this moment. What do you think? (Daniel?)  [reply] Comment 10 Daniel Stucky 2009-01-27 09:42:15 EST At the moment the LuceneIndexService reads the configuration (that is the Mappings.xml and the DataDictionary.xml) at startup and creates the indexes that do not exist.  Of course one could do this check dynamically, reloading the configuration files if any unkwon index name is used or one could add a watcher on the configuration files listening for changes on those files and triggering reinitialization of the service.  But what happens to changes of the configuration of an existing index ? I think they should not be effective as long as the index is not deleted manually by a user.  [reply] Comment 11 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-27 10:08:53 EST Yes i forget the Mappings.xml.  I've to explain my idea a little bit more.   I thought the index were right now created dynamically while crawling, thank you for the information that they are created at startup.  i want to talk here more about the Create index, because until we have a new search implementation the user should not have to create entries manually in the datadictionary. Right now the delete_index command delete entries in the Datadictionary, that means we need some implementation that can create that entries (triggered with a command). That the index and datadictionary were created automatically while crawling was only a special idea, a fallback.  I am not against that the user have to create the index manually (with a command) before he starts crawling (atm i would be better than creating indices automatically at startup/with the crawling).  My Idea was that the entries that are needed for the datadictionary are stored (like indexorder configurations) in files and we can order the framework (with a jmx-command ""create_index"") to create an index and the datadictionary entries with the information from the file (e.g. create_index test_index.xml and test_index.xml contains the datadictionary information for the index). Ivan has it right now implemented that the create_index -method can be used to send the datadictionary-content remotely (what is also an interesting solution, which we should allow/implement). I forget the Mappings.xml (like i said), do you have both ideas to integrate that information somehow into the idea i described? create_index need information for the datadictionary and for creating/haveing some mappings-information. (it should be a very simple solution/implementation because we will change it anyways with the new search implementation)  Why would it be necessary to restart the service?  Georg suggested maybe to have for every index a service...but that would be too ... ,or?  [reply] Comment 12 Daniel Stucky 2009-01-27 10:42:24 EST For index creation the mapping.xml is not needed, it is needed when a record is indexed (to map record attributes to index fields).  Logically a new index entry in the DataDictionary.xml imples a new index entry in the mapping.xml, otherwise there will be errors when indexing records.  The Service itself needs never to be be restarted, but if the configuration changes it needs to reload the config files. That was meant with ""reinitialize"".  With OSGi DS it's easily possible to have multiple LuceneIndexServices. However, you want to be able to add indexes dynamically. This means - dynamic service creation of more instances of LuceneIndexService - dynamic creation of pipelines, as each pipeline has to use another service instance - dynamic adaptation of router rules Altogether this is a really BAD idea !!!  Therefore I added the annotation that allows to tell the service which index to use!  So the only question is how are the configuration files updated and when are the indexes created. Personally I like the service to create indexes automatically.  [reply] Comment 13 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-28 09:26:23 EST At the moment the Datadictionary is updated with the command Delete / Rename Index.

Now user should post complete index DataDictionary xml node. Mappings are not added.  I did task as it was declared but I unable to understand the real usefulness of that operations. SMILA workflow is a set of dependent configurations of many bundles.  I found only one useful application of that api, it allows to backup a part of lucene index gtom gui --  to rename ""test_index"" to ""test_index1"" and to create ""test_index"" again :)  [reply] Comment 15 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-28 15:31:44 EST current problems with the current implementation: no separation between configation for an index and its current status (delete_index deletes also entry (first approach was that the DataDictionary should always fit to the current status in Lucene and Pipelet creates all indices that are defined in the datadictionary)  Result: The DIndex settings are lost for the user after delete  i suggest the following changes: 1) indices (lucene) are created with create_index or in the addRecord Method( if no index exits) create_index has one parameter: the index_name create_index searchs the DIndex for that name in the DataDictionary and creates an index based on this settings 2) DataDictionary is the configuration file for the user --> delete_index: no changes to the datadictionary --> rename_index: DIndex is renamed ( i think that is ok for the user) this is be done because search needs the settings  [reply] Comment 16 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-28 15:48:43 EST addition to my last comment/idea: Mappings.xml is also a user configuration file The code will not change it.

(bwt, maybe it's more correct here to create a copy of DIndex with new name)  [reply] Comment 18 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-29 05:59:02 EST final Decision for preliminary solution:  1) DataDictionary and Mapping are files that are managed ONLY by the user  2) Lucene Indicies are created dynamically/ on demand - Pipelet should cache somewhere if a lcuene idnex exists (please no checkIndex for every Record) 3) delete Index -- delete Lcuene Index only 4) rename Index --> rename only the Lucene Index (user has to create by its own a DINdex-part in the DataDictionary) 5) createIndex Parameter: Indexname, pipelet will search a DIndex in the Datadictionary and will create a Lucene Index  First Implementation: Datadictionary are only loaded at startup (no changes at runtime)    For further implementations: Ivan suggested that the DIndex is more a Type of Configuration and there will be lists which maps the existing indices to the Index Type (which contains the search /index configuration)   [reply] Comment 19 Sebastian Voigt 2009-01-29 11:26:21 EST Ivan found out, that the datadictionary have to be sychroniuzed always with the existing directories.  Therefore we decided to use the DataDictionary.xml in the workspace folder. It is always updated!  And furthermore we have a file in the config -folder, that can be used by the user to create Index/Search Settings for indices. If such an Index is created / (manual with create_index) or automatically (when an index is used by the pipelet) the datadictionaryController will search for such settings in the file in the config folder and will create in the datadictionary such index/settings. --> User can setup Settings in the file in the config folder and the datadictionry (which is stored in the workspace) is always updated (like before in anyfinder)  [reply] Comment 20 Ivan Churkin 2009-02-10 08:16:17 EST guess fixed  [reply] Comment 21 Andreas Weber 2013-04-15 11:41:04 EDT Closing this  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",churkin.ivan@gmail.com

It seems the crawling was to slow, result was that only 1 record was everytime in the queue, thus the multiple dfps wasnt faster than the router. Our question is: Overhead of the ActiveMQ (can it be tested with persistence and without?) Add some performance counters for bandwith if needed.  [reply] Comment 1 Ivan Churkin 2008-11-20 05:01:28 EST (In reply to comment #0) Basically I do not understand the problem...  It is obvious that one DFP will be faster.  Reasons:  Guess 2 nodes was started on one computer :) (limited resources). The main reason that processing is not resource consuming now. It is too fast :). It's easier and faster to process record immediately than to persist message to MQ and process it later.  Crawling -> mainly HDD load Persisting into JMS -> mainly HDD load Processing -> mainly CPU load  There is no one reason to make delayed processing is processing is fast. There is no reasons to persist messages into in the same node where file-crawling executed.

[reply] Comment 1 Marius Cimpean 2008-11-25 09:03:18 EST The BDB Xml backup & restore procedures are available via BDB tools (executable files - Cpp sources that have been transformed in exe files).  From this point of view the backup & restore mechanism can be based on one of the following options: 1. call the exe files with the appropriate parameters (starting new process) Advantages: less effort (already in the sandbox), when upgrading to new versions we only supply the new db tools Disadvantage: not Java code  2. Implement (migrate Cpp classes to Java) for backup & restore - Advantage: Java code control Disadvantage: much more effort for implementation; upgrading to new BDB Xml versions may need re-implementation - changes  So, basically I just want to know your opinion, constraints (if any) about this.  http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?forumID=274&threadID=448577&messageID=3140475#3140475  [reply] Comment 2 Marius Cimpean 2008-11-27 05:06:38 EST The ssandbox contains the org.eclipse.smila.bdbxmltest project where the following functionalities and tests have been implemented and tested: - backup (hotbackup and incremental backup) through the DB tools (db_hotbackup and db_recovery) and API implementation - recovery (normal recovery and catastrophic recovery) through DB tools (db_recovery) and API implementation  The tests use to populate one environment with 4 containers in three different ways (which are relevant for the data integrity when backup&restore while transaction are still being executed).  Following tests are covered: - Hotackup with normal recovery while inserting documents - Hotbackup with normal recovery - Hotbackup with catastrophic recovery - Hotbackup with catastrophic recovery by using the BS tools (programmatically).  [reply] Comment 3 Marius Cimpean 2008-11-27 14:24:47 EST Tested hot_backup and recovery during multiple threads writing into the environment containers with deadlocks-resolving.  Tests succeeded even if hot-backup was done during deadlocks-resolving. The restored environment contained all data that was backed-up till the moment of backup execution.  The recovered data 's integrity is fine - that means all recovered documents are available with the new restored environment.  Tested indexes : - environment with two containers (both containers have been populated with 5000 documents - same content); One environment is indexed by one of the xml element; the other container rhas no index.  After populating the two containers and performing queries (identical query) for both containers the results are in advantage of the indexed container:  XQuery: collection(""notIndexedContainer.dbxml"")/testDoc[docId=""450-0-6""] - took 562 ms ; returned one document  XQuery: collection(""indexedContainer.dbxml"")/testDoc[docId=""450-0-6""] - took 2 ms; returned one document  The population time of the two containers is not relevant (considering that one container is indexed and the other isn't)  [reply] Comment 4 thomas menzel 2009-06-19 08:30:48 EDT closing this as BDX CQ has been revoked  [reply] Comment 5 thomas menzel 2009-06-19 08:30:58 EDT closing this as BDX CQ has been revoked  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",tmenzel@brox.de

""Content-type: text/html""  We can add attribute to MetaAttribute configuration that will allow to configure how headers are returned:  1. as a header line The same structure like it is implemented now  2. return only metadata values In this case meta names will be stripped and only values will be returned:  <A n=""MetaType""> <L> <V>MetaValue1</V> <V>MetaValue2</V> ... </L> </A>   For example,  <A n=""MimeType""> <L> <V>text/html</V> </L> </A>  3. return metadata as a multiple attributes In this case meta attributes will be collected into nested MObject:  <A n=""MetaType""> <O> <A n=""MetaName1""> <L> <v>MetaValue1</V> </L> </A> <A n=""MetaName2""> <L> <v>MetaValue2</V> </L> </A> ... </O> </A>  for example:   <A n=""ResponseHeader""> <O> <A n=""Content-Type""> <L> <v>text/html</V> </L> </A> <A n=""Date""> <L> <v>Mon, 01 Dec 2008 17:01:30 GMT</V> </L> </A> ... </O> </A>  [reply] Comment 4 Sebastian Voigt 2008-12-02 06:19:21 EST implement 2 and 3 also 3 for returning all Response Headers or only some specifc (defined somehow in the IndexOrderConfiguration)  [reply] Comment 5 Dmitry Hazin 2008-12-03 06:31:02 EST Committed changes and updated documentation at http://wiki.eclipse.org/SMILA/Documentation/Web_Crawler  [reply] Comment 6 Andreas Weber 2013-04-15 11:33:34 EDT Closing this  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",dhazin@gmail.com

This contribution looks great.  Thanks so much Marcelo for all the work...we're getting there very rapidly, I think.  Some comments and questions:  In IUserSearchManager API:  You've got two search methods...i.e.  ISearch search(ICriteria criteria) throws ContainerConnectException;  and  void search(IUserSearchListener)  First, questions about ISearch search(ICriteria criteria):  1) why throw ContainerConnectException?  Rather than use this exception, I would suggest creating a new exception class (e.g. UserSearchException) that extends ECFException...and possibly adds access to the criteria associated with the search (e.g. UserSearchException.getSearchCriteria())  2) Doesn't the async search need to be given an ICriteria like the synchronous search(ICriteria).  That is, how is the client going to specify the criteria for the asynchronous search if not as a parameter to the search method?  e.g.  public void search(ICriteria criteria, IUserSearchListener listener);  3) I would suggest that the IUserSearchListener have just one method instead of two:  public void handleUserSearchEvent(IUserSearchEvent event);  with IUserSearchEvent declaring a single method:  ICriteria getCriteria();  Also I suggest that there be different sub-interfaces of IUserSearchEvent to represent different types of events...e.g.  class IUserSearchCompleteEvent  ISearch getSearch();  It may be, for example, that there is *only* IUserSearchCompleteEvent to begin with...and other interfaces added later.  Things look good Marcelo...let's get these things worked out and we'll get the API and xmpp impl into ECF 3.0M5.  Thanks.

The idea is to use a defined neutral behavior, and furthermore implementing the IUserSearchManager#isEnable() is an ""interesting"" way to advice the menu doesn't consider the ""User Search"" feature.  > > I don't particularly like the name ISelection as it will conflict with JFace's > ISelection interface.

This is looking good.  A few very minor comments.  I see that you renamed ISelection to IRestriction as per comment #10.  But the IUserSearchManager.createSelection() should probably then be renamed to createRestriction().  WRT Javadocs...would be good if you could add some docs in IUserSearchManager.search/1 and search/2 for the 'criteria' parameter (e.g. is it ok to be null in particular).  Typo in javadocs for search/2:  ""This method can apply search to math the specific criteria...""  'math' should be 'match' I think.  For this method:  public String[] getUserPropertiesFields() throws ContainerConnectException;  Why would it be ContainerConnectException?  Should it be ECFException instead (e.g. to allow for exceptions in the blocking call rather than the connect?).  If getUserPropertiesFields() can block, would be good to note this in javadocs.  In AbstractUserSearchListener the UserListener class code (i.e. the imple of handleUserSearchEvent(IUserSearchEvent) doesn't seem quite right as:  1) You currently have the code in the if (event instanceof IUserSearchCompleteEvent) commented out  2) The conditional 'else if (event instanceof IUserSearchEvent)' is not needed (given that the IUserSearchEvent is the type passed into handleUserSearchEvent).  3) the catch (UserSearchException e) {  e.printStackTrace() } isn't a very good idea :).  4) Would it make sense to make fireUserSearchEvent() protected (rather than public), as I think it's intended for subclasses, correct?  5) I don't see the use for the 'criteria' member on AbstractUserSearchManager...or how it's set to begin with.  Might want to remove it.  With these fixes/changes and ones that others identify, I think things are looking close to ready for releasing/merging to HEAD for M5.  When you are ready to do this please coordinate with me, as there are other projects that implement the presence API that have to be updated so as to compile in our daily build (so checking in these additions without updating the other projects will break the osu daily build...i.e. yahoo, twitter, skype, aim providers).

2008-12-12 08:07:38 EST,257042,[Blackboard API] Temporary File Access,"[Blackboard API] Temporary File Access [reply] Description Sebastian Voigt 2008-12-01 04:57:20 EST We need (especially for the Stellent Pipelet) an java File (Class/Reference) access for Attachments.  That means: Attachments should be accessible with a File Ref: File getAttachmentAsFile(Id, String attachmentName) Blackboard should create a Temporary File and return File for it this temporary Should be automatically deleted, when pipelet has finished the work. This file should not be changeable (if we should really monitor this?). With a special command / flag, the file should be allowed to be changed from the pipelet, and what is more important: the content of this file should be written to the attachment in the blackboard-record. That means pipelets can use this workflow to update attachments and they can work with File-References.  Please make some suggestions regarding the ""write""-flag, then implement it  [reply] Comment 1 Juergen Schumacher 2008-12-01 05:17:41 EST I think the main functionality should already be part of the BinStorage API, because BinStorage may be able to use have more efficient methods for providing this file than reading the complete stream into a new temporary file. For example, the current Java-IO based approach could create a file object immediately for the file in the BinStorage without having to copy it. Or dou you think this could problems with write-access to this file? Then maybe still we could use this approach for read-only access and to the copying only when the client requests write access.  This means the BinStorage API would be enhanced by methods like - File getFileAccess(String id, boolean write) - void releaseFile(String id)  and the Blackboard would use these methods and add the necessary synchronization with the record instance on the blackboard.  [reply] Comment 2 Dmitry Hazin 2008-12-01 06:25:08 EST I think it should be ok to use BinStorage functionality with current implementation. But further if BinStorage will be remote service, getting File from BinStorage will make no sence.  [reply] Comment 3 Sebastian Voigt 2008-12-01 06:40:39 EST Yes, in the case that we use remote communication with the binstorage we can create a local copy when we read the attachments (have to read it). I've discussed it a little bit with georg (in more detail): we think we should have two methods beside the existing api: File getAttachmentAsFile(id, attachmentName): would read it (like getasInputStream) from the binstorage and create a local copy (we should discuss if the getAsInputstream also create a local copy every time --> that means we try to cache the attachments like we do it with the record (is not implemented by now).  setAttachmentAsFile(id, attachmentName, File) The Pipelet user can sent a file as attachment to the record. Two use cases: use it with a File that was retrieved with get...AsFile(): 1) User has worked (changed) with the local File and want to inform the Blackboard about it. 2) User wants to add self created file to record The Set..AsFile-method makes the talk about the flag/command about changed local files obsolet.   the temporary files should only be deleted after the end of the pipeline (not after each pipelet), or when the local file isnt used anymore ( File A1 = getAsFile(); setAsFile(..., A2)--> temporary file of A1 can be deleted). Blackboard has to monitor the local temporary files and the reference to the attachments.  [reply] Comment 4 Dmitry Hazin 2008-12-03 12:06:00 EST If BinStorage API would be enhanced by methods like - File getFileAccess(String id, boolean write) - void releaseFile(String id) does this mean that they should be implemented for all present binstorage BinaryPersistence implementations? This method will become obsolete with remote binstorage service, so should it really be implemented for all implementations?  [reply] Comment 5 Dmitry Hazin 2008-12-12 08:07:38 EST Added two methods: getAttachmentAsFile: creates copy of the attachment into local temporary file and returns File object; setAttachmentFromFile: saves attachment from file to BinaryStorage.  Temporary files are removed when record is committed (Probably also remove all temp files on blackboard activation/deactivation?).

But we need feedback, thus could you please adopt file and web-crawler to this new api and give us feedback: - personal opionion - advantages/Disadvantages from the view of a crawler developer - api understandable?  the new crawler api is stored in the sandbox, please copy bundles to that place also, if you have to change them (obviously the crawler bundles). dont change code in the svn-trunk please  [reply] Comment 1 Dmitry Hazin 2009-01-26 05:04:10 EST Adopted crawlers code is in the sandbox. Here is my feedback: New crawler api is a bit simpler for crawler developer then previous version but isn't too much different. New api is more clear for crawler developer in case that he doesn't need to handle the DI list and getRecord(int pos) method, returning record by Id is much more clear. Also it's good that hash is now calculated inside the crawler by use of DataReferenceFactory. However new api has some new weaknesses. In the previous version crawler developer had first to prepare MObject containing DI data and then the actual record. With new API DataReference replaced MObject containing di data and to construct DataReference object developer must call factory method with id attributes, hash attributes and attachments parameters. The problem is that there is no handy container class for DataReferenceFactory parameters (it was MObject in previous implementation). For example, when adopting crawlers, I used Record object to keep parameters that were needed for DataReference creation, but I still had to implement functions that separate atrributes to id, hash and attachments attributes. Another difficulty for the crawler developer (not directly related to new api) is that he must be aware of differences between record attributes and record attachments, treat them differently and serialize attachments to byte[] every time.

I talk with the derby team via their mailing-list and ask for incompatibilities. There answer me the following: ＾There are some incompatibilities that have been introduced intentionally. These have been documented in the release notes. Unfortunately, you'll have to go through the notes for all releases between the one one you're going from and the one you're going to. Here are the ones describing potential incompatibilities between 10.1.3.1 and the current 10.4.2.0 release:  Differences between 10.1.3.1 and 10.2.1.6: http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.2.1.6.html  Differences between 10.2.1.6 and 10.2.2.0: http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.2.2.0.html  Differences between 10.2.2.0 and 10.3.1.4: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/db/derby/code/tags/10.3.1.4/RELEASE-NOTES.html?view=co  Differences between 10.3.1.4 and 10.3.2.1: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/db/derby/code/tags/10.3.2.1/RELEASE-NOTES.html?view=co  Differences between 10.3.2.1 and 10.4.1.3: http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.4.1.3.html  Differences between 10.4.1.3 and 10.4.2.0: http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.4.2.0.cgi＾ After talking with Thomas again I try to find out if the ActiveMQ in SMILA generally uses derby, but I found nothing relating to ActiveMQ and derby together. I read that derby is an optional ActiveMQ feature, so now I ask you if we need derby or not.  [reply] Comment 2 thomas menzel 2009-01-21 09:19:15 EST http://activemq.apache.org/amq-message-store.html  shows how the back end storage of AMQ is config'ed and this make clear that derby is clearly optional and even the incompatibility between the versions should not result in any problems when using derby with AMQ.  currently AMQ is not using derby in smila, although it would be possible.  having said this i could with draw the CQ completely but instead of this i let the CQ be changed to v 10.4.1.3 as we us derby (albeit an older version) for the DB crawler test and hence need to file a CQ for derby in that context when putting the tests into eclipse SVN.  to avoid all this i just reuse the CQ 2732 (https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2732) as described above.  funny thing: the derby lib is not even currently in trunk\org.apache.activemq.core\lib ...

This results in an exception of the form:  Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/osgi/framework/internal/core/BundleLoader at org.eclipse.mtj.core.hooks.MTJClassLoadingHook.createClassLoader(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.osgi.baseadaptor.BaseData.createClassLoader(BaseData.java:92) at org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.BundleLoader.createBCL(BundleLoader.java:821)  While the hope is to move to the new JDT extension point for handling preprocessing, it would be worthwhile for the current hooks to work just in case.  [reply] Comment 1 Craig Setera 2009-01-18 21:48:56 EST Fixed on trunk.  The createClassLoader method of the MTJClassLoadingHook class was altered to use Java reflection to locate the method to be called.  This allows the code to avoid directly referencing the BundleLoader class that was refactored in Eclipse 3.5.  The resulting code works in both Eclipse 3.4 and 3.5.

One idiom that we've adopted in WTP, and our adopter product, is to allow a mutli-page editor which doesn't implement ITextEditor itself to return ITextEditor as an adapter, providing access to its source page (assuming it only has one such page, we never worked out the semantics beyond that).  Most of the time this is the actual editor part embedded as the source page, providing a straightforward way to enable support in editors like WTP's XML Editor.  I intend to add docshare to the WTP Source Editing M6 plan, but it would be a shame for our multi-page editors to not support this properly.  Patch attached adding the various calls in the DocShare plug-in to make use of this pattern, and remove an unnecessary restriction on its use with IFileEditorInput.

There is a new Suspend/Resume pushbutton added to the Accprobe toolbar ""Suspend all actions"". Once pressed, this will stop all tracking, event monitoring events from being processed. Highliging and 'Always on Top' will also also disabled. When the Suspend/Resume button is pressed again, Accprobe will return to its previous state.  The user will still be able to make changes to the Accprobe options/preferences in suspended mode with the exception of 'Always on Top'.

In reality, even though the sub-properties may be selected using the associated checkbox,  these sub-properties are not selectable.

In my crawler configuration I renamed the ""Path"" attribute, e.g. ... <Attribute Type=""String"" Name=""MyPath"" KeyAttribute=""true""> <FileAttributes>Path</FileAttributes> </Attribute> ... and got a NullPointerException in the FileSystemCrawler (line 312):  File file = new File(diData.getAttribute(FileAttributesType.PATH.value()).getLiteral().getStringValue());  This is reproducable.  I had a deeper look at it, and think I can provide a fix:  Instead of reading the path attribute with the hardcoded FileAttributesType.PATH, one has to find and use the configured path attribute name. So the line above could be replaced like that:  final String pathAttributeName = getPathAttributeName(); final File file = new File(diData.getAttribute(pathAttributeName).getLiteral().getStringValue());  private String getPathAttributeName() { for (Attribute a : _attributes) { if (a.getFileAttributes().equals(FileAttributesType.PATH)) { return a.getName(); } } return null; }  Find attached the patched FileSystemCrawler class.

2009-07-15 23:21:42 EDT,265664,EPF Richtext isn't firing ModifyEvents or KeyEvent when it should,"EPF Richtext isn't firing ModifyEvents or KeyEvent when it should [reply] Description Richard Bone 2009-02-20 11:08:10 EST Build ID: M20080911-1700  Steps To Reproduce: Using EPF: 1.5 build 20080714-1745, on windows XP  We're using the RichTextEditor in some modal dialogs, and have noticed that the events we're hooked into (ModifyEvent and KeyEvent) are not always being fired when we would expect them to.  I can generally be guaranteed that these events will fire if I select the FontStyle combo or if I hit return, but that's about it.  The way we're hooking in has varied.  Right now, on my class extending RichTextEditor, I hook into modify as follows...  richEditor.addModifyListener(new ModifyListener(){ public void modifyText(ModifyEvent e) { //enable some button } });  I've also tried doing the same, via richEditor.getRichTextControl().addModifyListener as well as both the preceding with addKeyListener.  I know that there have been issues with using the RichTextEditor within dialogs in the past.  Perhaps there is still some quirk of event firing in the RichTextEditor when being used in this fashion?   More information:  [reply] Comment 1 Bingxue Xu 2009-02-20 16:25:33 EST Please investigate this one.  [reply] Comment 2 Xiao Dan Xia 2009-02-24 05:16:27 EST Hi,  I wrote a test plugin to simulate the behavior. But I can't reproduce this issue.  My plugins is like this:  1. prepare a editor that extends EditorPart and implements IEditorInput, which will be used to provide editorSite to RTE 2. prepare a dialog that has a MethodRichTextEditor. The code is as below&#65306; protected Control createDialogArea(Composite parent) { Composite baseComposite = (Composite)  super.createDialogArea(parent);  MethodRichTextEditor rte = new MethodRichTextEditor(baseComposite, SWT.MULTI | SWT.WRAP | SWT.V_SCROLL, null, null, new Label(baseComposite, SWT.CENTER),editor.getEditorSite());  rte.addModifyListener(new ModifyListener(){ public void modifyText(ModifyEvent e) { System.out.println(""get modificaiton event: ""+(count++)); } }); //RTE configuration return baseComposite; }   3. when the test action is activated, the editor is intantiated. The editor's editorSite is then passed for dialog instantiation.  I tried editing actions like changing font style, inputting new characters, removing text, etc.,  I can always receive the modify event.  Can you show me your code?  [reply] Comment 3 Richard Bone 2009-05-01 13:01:07 EDT Hi,  It seems this doesn't happen on every Windows machine.  The only thing we do is add a modify listener to the RichText that we're using.  After debugging on a machine where it doesn't work, it turns out that the status text change events that should be fired from the browser aren't.  The OLE code that should be creating them isn't doing what it should, it seems.  [reply] Comment 4 Srimanth 2009-05-01 13:09:00 EDT We have hit this on multiple WinXP systems. Basically no key events are trigerred till you hit ENTER key. In the SWT Browser internals, the org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE class's OLEListener never gets any events (StatusTextChange).  We have both systems which work, and those which dont - we will be more than happy to let you debug on the problem machines if you cant reproduce it. This problem is a major one for us, as the rich text editor plays an important part in our tools usecase.  [reply] Comment 5 Richard Bone 2009-05-11 14:53:25 EDT Hi,  Has anyone had a chance yet to take another look at this problem?  As Sri mentioned on May 1st this is a big deal for our tooling and we'd love to know whether there is anything that can be done about it.  Thanks.  Richard  [reply] Comment 6 Xiao Dan Xia 2009-05-12 04:38:06 EDT I can't reproduce it on my two XP box. Both install IE7. Can you try to figure out where's the difference between the working system and non-working system? Such as checking IE versions? Or you can try using firefox by updating the Browser instantiate function in org.eclipse.epf.richtext.RichText.java with this code so as to see if it's browser issue or not?  public RichText(Composite parent, int style, String basePath) { .... try { editor = new Browser(parent, SWT.MOZILLA);  [reply] Comment 7 Richard Bone 2009-05-13 14:33:15 EDT Hi,  I did try instantiating the browser with SWT.MOZILLA, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  The behavior is the same as when I used IE.  I was using XULRunner 1.9.x to do the test. The IE version I have is 7 and I'm running on XP Pro SP2.  [reply] Comment 8 Jeff Hardy 2009-05-28 18:50:02 EDT Created attachment 137574 [details] test case to try to reproduce  [reply] Comment 9 Jeff Hardy 2009-05-28 18:53:35 EDT In comment #8 I attached a project to attempt to help isolate the issue.  This project uses plain SWT (no EPF RichText).  It creates a Dialog with a Browser widget in editing mode.  It attaches a key listener that outputs to the console when a KeyUp occurs.  This is the same method that the EPF RichText uses in the ModifyListener.  You did not specify which version of Eclipse you are using, so I used Eclipse 3.3.2, which is what EPF 1.5 is based on.  If you use a different version of Eclipse you'll have to fix the build path for the project.  Please try this on your affected machines - if the problem is reproducible, this indicates an SWT problem.  If the problem doesn't occur, then EPF RichText must be causing the issue somehow.  [reply] Comment 10 Richard Bone 2009-06-12 15:12:33 EDT So I tried the test that Jeff handed to me.  It didn't deliver the events at all.  I did add in a keyListener, which delivered the events as I would expect.  Jeff, you were saying that you thought this was an SWT problem, right?  [reply] Comment 11 Jeff Hardy 2009-06-12 15:55:11 EDT Yes, please file a new bug against SWT and list the bugzilla number here.  You may want to attach the test case so they can reproduce it.

[reply] Comment 17 Bingxue Xu 2009-06-12 20:37:54 EDT Thanks much for the testing. Please try it on Eclipse 3.3.x and if it works, then it would be very easy for the SWT team to figure out the difference between them.  [reply] Comment 18 Richard Bone 2009-06-12 21:20:01 EDT Just for the record... if you modify Jeff's test to do this...  browserControl.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() { public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""KeyPressed: "" + e.widget); } });  ... it displays KeyPressed just fine.  Jeff, I also tried running your test on 3.3.2 and it works fine.  Since it's obvious that SWT has changed something about the way they handle key events from 3.3.x to 3.4.x, can we look into getting it to work on these platforms? There are quite a few products out there running on 3.4 and above at this point.

This is my test code:  Shell shell = new Shell(Display.getCurrent().getActiveShell(), SWT.CLOSE); shell.setLayout(new FillLayout()); IRichText richTextComponent = RichTextFormToolkit.createRichText(new FormToolkit(Display.getCurrent()), shell, null, SWT.NONE); richTextComponent.addModifyListener(new ModifyListener() { @Override public void modifyText(ModifyEvent e) { System.out.println(""modifyText "" + e); } }); richTextComponent.addKeyListener(new KeyListener() { @Override public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""keyReleased "" + e); }  @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""keyPressed "" + e); } }); shell.open();  I would like to get EVERY key stroke.

This is a SWT problem in eclipse 3.4 and above.

I made a little Test Plug-in (will attach it), maybe you can try it out and tell me if you get any output in the console when typing.  View.java IRichText richText = RichTextFormToolkit.createRichText(toolkit, parent, null, SWT.NONE); richText.addModifyListener(new ModifyListener() { @Override public void modifyText(ModifyEvent e) { System.out.println(""modifyText: "" + e);  } }); richText.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() { @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""keyPressed: "" + e); } });  BTW I'm using Eclipse 3.5.1  [reply] Comment 33 Flavio Donze 2009-12-18 02:45:38 EST Created attachment 154748 [details] EPF RichtText Test Plug-in  [reply] Comment 34 Flavio Donze 2009-12-18 08:25:49 EST I gave the test to two of our other software developers.

[reply] Comment 36 Xiao Dan Xia 2009-12-20 12:19:25 EST on Windows, you need to use editorControl to manage the listener. Following code is an sample:  Control browserControl = getControlSite((Composite)richText.getRichTextControl().getControl());   browserControl.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() { @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { System.out.println(""keyPressed: "" + e); } });  protected Control getControlSite(Composite composite) { Control[] controls = composite.getChildren(); for (int i = 0; i < controls.length; i++) { String controlClass = controls[i].getClass().getName(); if (controlClass.equals(""org.eclipse.swt.browser.WebSite"")) { //$NON-NLS-1$ return controls[i]; } else if (controls[i] instanceof Composite) { return getControlSite((Composite) controls[i]); } } return null; }  [reply] Comment 37 Flavio Donze 2009-12-22 04:17:13 EST Hi Xiao Dan Xia,  Thanks for this tip. I do get the KeyEvents now. But shouldn't this issue be reopened since this is a workaround? I still don't get the modify events.  I have a different problem with the solution you describe. I want to use databinding so I added a KeyAdapter and want to update my business object on every keystroke.  public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { String newValue = editor.getText(); ... }  Now when I type 'abc' I do get the 'c' event but the 'newValue' is still 'ab'. Storing my business object the value is cut of 'ab' instead of 'abc'.  Maybe this would work with the modify event but since I don't receive those I'm screwed :-).  [reply] Comment 38 Bingxue Xu 2010-01-04 19:41:49 EST I'd suggest opening a bug or discussion against SWT/broswer widget by preparing some test plug-ins directly to prove or disapprove the events are been sent or received. If those are bugs or inteneded changes with the newer versions of SWT, EPF could not fix them.  Thanks.  [reply] Comment 39 Xiao Dan Xia 2010-01-05 10:07:27 EST I tried my test plugin on eclipse 3.3.2 and eclipse 3.5.0. On eclipse 3.3.2, modify event can be received and text can be correctly retrieved. On eclipse 3.5.0, I can't get modify event as well as keyReleased event(I can get keyPressed event). So, it should be a SWT problem. Can you try your plugin on eclipse3.3.2? BTW, there's already a bug against SWT(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=280146) to track keyUp issue. You may add comments and discussion there.  [reply] Comment 40 Flavio Donze 2010-01-06 07:39:41 EST I've tested my test plug-in with eclipse 3.2.2 and I do get the ModifyEvents and keyPressed.  As mentioned above I have done some hacking in the passed (July 2009) on the rte.js file. Afterwards I did get ModifyEvents using eclipse 3.5.1 but still having a strange behavior. see the following link for details: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=tree&th=16670&S=28cf035914bb5b2b73482ea57f1ed6c8#page_top  I actually ""don't care"" about the KeyEvents, I would rather get the modify events for my databinding. Maybe fixing the rte.js file would solve the issue?  [reply] Comment 41 Xiao Dan Xia 2010-01-07 05:00:09 EST For your case, as a workaround, you can try move your change to function keyReleased() and attach keyrelease event to this function. Refer to following code fragment.  function enableRichTextEditing(html) { ...  if (""attachEvent"" in doc) { doc.attachEvent(""onkeyup"", keyReleased); .... } if (""addEventListener"" in doc) { doc.addEventListener(""keypress"", keyPressed, true); doc.addEventListener(""keyrelease"", keyReleased, true); ... }   function keyReleased(event) { var keyCode = event.keyCode; if (keyCode == 0 && !document.all) { keyCode = event.charCode; switch (keyCode) { case 98: keyCode = KEY_B; break; case 99: keyCode = KEY_C; break; case 102: keyCode = KEY_F; break; case 105: keyCode = KEY_I; break; case 115: keyCode = KEY_S; break; case 117: keyCode = KEY_U; break; case 118: keyCode = KEY_V; break; case 120: keyCode = KEY_X; break; case 122: keyCode = KEY_Z; break; } } var ctrlKey = event.ctrlKey; var shiftKey = event.shiftKey; var altKey = event.altKey;  if ( !ctrlKey && !altKey ) { var modified = true; for (var i = 0; i < excludeModify.length; i++ ) { if ( keyCode == excludeModify[i] ) { modified = false; } } if ( modified == true ) { setTimeout(""setStatus(STATUS_MODIFIED, null);"", 10); } } }  [reply] Comment 42 Flavio Donze 2010-01-07 11:18:01 EST Thanks a lot. I do now get my desired ModifyEvents. Also when CTRL or ALT is pressed but that doesn't matter I can handle this in my listener.  But shouldn't this issue be reopened since there are still problems around?  greets and thanks again!

2009-04-10 01:45:22 EDT,269992,[EWM] Add logging support to the EMF workflow model,"[EWM] Add logging support to the EMF workflow model [reply] Description Bryan Hunt 2009-03-25 11:58:31 EDT During my talk on the EMF workflow model, it was suggested to add logging capabilities to the workflow model.  This bug will track any ideas on the best way to do this.  [reply] Comment 1 Eike Stepper 2009-03-25 16:40:20 EDT In a similar effort I worked on in the past I added some logging API to the workflow execution context that gets passed into all the lifecycle methods (do you have component lifecycle??) andinto the run() methods of the components. That turned out to be very convenient because the framework can create/maintain the logger instances and associate them with the target components.  As a related matter (might need a separate bugzilla) I added API to the execution context that can be used by the lifecycle/run methods to report cross reference information towards the framework. The framework can use this information in subsequent executions to more intelligently determine the set of components that need re-execution. Maybe this is only applicable to code generator workflows. I used it to optimize re-generation of artifacts based on particular model changes.  [reply] Comment 2 Miles Parker 2009-04-01 23:04:57 EDT Hi guys,  I've actually spent quite a bit of time implementing this -- at least I think we're talking about the same thing. This is stuff I built for the generators for my MetaABM project so would be (assuming all goes well) part of the Eclipse AMP project eventually.  Haven't yet made the leap to MWE so these are all based on oAW Workflow.  It all work quite well. The current basic user story is..  1. User invokes builder. (This could easily be generalized to any workflow invocation.) 2. Generator executes. 3. On completion: a) if workflow error(s) occurred: present to user and log. (All errors are stored and placed in multi-status list so only one error reported per workflow invoke at workflow termination == No spamming error log. :) ) b) if warnings occurred, log. (Again, one multi per workflow.) c) otherwise, log an info for successful completion. 4. Traps RuntimeExceptions that occur during generator invocation and reports them as errors in 3.  But wait, there's more..  4. On .chk error or warning: Creates markers from invoked Workflow object for the producing EObject in the EMF editor. Users can then double-click on problem markers and EMF editor object is selected just as with validation errors.  and..  5. An extendible builder for arbitrary workflows on all models instances of a provided ecore model within a project.  6. Generic handlers for invoking workflows using the builder. Users simply have to override the ResourceJobHandler#execute with a call to the appropriate builder, and register the handler extension.  I'm attaching a few classes. They aren't perfect, my lack of documentation is embarrassing. ;) There also need to be generalized, obviously. See note for LogOAW.. will have issues in the (unlikely?) case of parallel generation.  My eventual plan was to provide an extension point for all of this so that plugin developers would only have to provide a workflow reference and an ecore extension to provide a custom workflow builder.  If MWE team think it is worth polishing up (as I make the transition) then let me know and I'll do that. (I hold copyright and can release as ECL, but don't (yet?!) have committer status.)  Here is what is going on in the classes:  AbstractOAWBuilder -- manages all aspects of build process, including logging, reporting and markers LogOAW -- collects workflow log issues as they occur. OAWUIExceptionHandler -- intercepts workflow caused RTE for log.  ModelMarkerHelper -- support for supplying workflow objects with problem markers.  ResourceHandler, ResourceJobHandler -- Handler support for invoking the builder manually on single resource.  GenerateInterfaceHandler -- example of usage of above  To make ModelMarkers work, you'd need to edit generated EMF Editor as in the below..  /** * <!-- begin-user-doc --> <!-- end-user-doc --> * * @generated NOT */ public void gotoMarker(IMarker marker) { try { if (marker.getType().equals(EValidator.MARKER)) { String uriAttribute = marker.getAttribute(EValidator.URI_ATTRIBUTE, null); if (uriAttribute != null) { URI uri = URI.createURI(uriAttribute); EObject eObject = editingDomain.getResourceSet().getEObject(uri, true); if (eObject != null) { setSelectionToViewer(Collections.singleton(editingDomain.getWrapper(eObject))); } } } else if (marker.getType().equals(ModelMarkerHelper.MARKER_ID)) { String elementPath = marker.getAttribute(ModelMarkerHelper.MARKER_ELEMENT, null); URI uri = URI.createURI(elementPath); EObject eObject = editingDomain.getResourceSet().getEObject(uri, true); if (eObject != null) { setSelectionToViewer(Collections.singleton(editingDomain.getWrapper(eObject))); } else { StatusManager.getManager().handle( new Status(Status.WARNING, ""org.metaabm.ide"", ""Couldn't locate: "" + uri)); } } } catch (CoreException exception) { MetaModelerPlugin.INSTANCE.log(exception); } }   [reply] Comment 3 Miles Parker 2009-04-01 23:08:39 EDT Created attachment 130646 [details] oAW Logging Implementation  [reply] Comment 4 Miles Parker 2009-04-01 23:10:16 EDT For further context, see:  http://svn.metascapeabm.com/metaabm/org.metaabm.ide/src/org/metaabm/ide/  [I really need to factor this stuff out!]  [reply] Comment 5 Bryan Hunt 2009-04-02 00:06:58 EDT Based on the comments so far, here's what I'm thinking:  Create a Log class that holds logging information for a WorkflowUnitOfWork and store instances of the Log in the WorkflowContext mapped with the instance of WorkflowUnitOfWork as the key just like the state information.  public class WorkflowLog { public Collection getAll(); public Collection getErrors(); public Collection getWarnings(); public Collection getInfos();  public void log(...); // Not sure of the parameters, but want to avoid IStatus }  An example of it's use:  public class MyTask extends WorkflowUnitOfWork { protected void run(WorkflowContext context) { Log log = getLog(context); log.log(LogLevel.INFO, ""Starting execution""); } }  [reply] Comment 6 Bryan Hunt 2009-04-02 00:12:52 EDT (In reply to comment #1) > workflow execution context that gets passed into all the lifecycle methods (do > you have component lifecycle??) andinto the run() methods of the components.  I do not have component lfecycle methods.  I do keep the component state, which is related to the lifecycle of the component in the WorkflowContext.  I could not think of a compelling usecase for lifecycle methods.  If you need to do any processing before or after the run method, why not just add a task.

I've applied the patch.  It looks terrific!  Only a few small questions:  In IMessageSearchManager:  1) You have the two search methods take a String as the criteria...why does it not take an ICriteria instance (i.e. using a createCriteria(String) method on the IMessageSearchManager?)  This would be closer to the user search manager, wouldn't it?  2) there is an isEnabled() method...given that the IChatManager.getMessageSearchManager() method could return null (to indicate that their is no message search manager), would it make sense to just remove isEnabled()?  3) The javadocs for everything looks really good.  Thanks for doing all that documentation.  I'm +1 on adding this API as soon as reasonable.  Note that I noticed (via the PDE API tools) that the @since 3.0 tags should probably be @since 2.0 (because the presence API bundle is currently at 2.0 rather than 3.0).

[reply] Description Stan Vassilev 2009-05-13 09:56:01 EDT Build ID: M20080911-1700  Steps To Reproduce: There is no good way to type hint a method which returns $this.  Currently we only can specify the current class, which works fine, unless we extend the class, example:  class Foo { function fooMethod() {}  /** * @return Foo */ function fluentMethod() { return $this; } }  class Bar extends Foo { function barMethod() {} }  $bar = new Bar();  // if you type the code below you will see a hint about // about fooMethod(), but not about barMethod() as there // is no way to type hint the dynamic nature of fluent // interfaces that return $this:  $bar->fluentMethod()->...  Suggested behavior and syntax:  /** * @return self */ function fluentMethod() { return $this; }  When the above syntax is used, Eclipse PDT will assume the return class is the same class that invokes the method, never mind where in the inheritance chain the method itself was declared.  If this solution is deemed sound, I will also talk to people at phpDocumentor so it can be added to the PHPDoc standard.  [reply] Comment 1 Stan Vassilev 2009-05-14 10:27:22 EDT The bug was added to PEAR and it seems it'll go there as in few variations:  @return $this @return self  and possibly: @return static  http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=16223  To avoid confusion, I suggest the following implementation with possibility to extend later:  ""@return $this"", only for non-static methods.

So Emily gets to join the fun! :-)  ""Accessible"" software is software that can be used effectively by people with visual or other disabilities.  Examples of making software accessible is providing keyboard alternatives to mouse actions and making it possible for a user to navigate a user interface using screen reader software that ""speaks"" the content of the screen.  DTP should be accessible. It's not merely a ""good thing to do""; many government agencies and purchase contracts require that the software purchased be accessible, and we would like the products based on DTP to qualify.  Please take a few minutes to download the attached Software Accessibility Checklist, fill it out, and re-attach it to this bug.  Mark the Status column of each item as Yes, No, or NA.  Provide comments when necessary.  For more information about the accessibility and the Software Accessibility Checklist, visit http://www-03.ibm.com/able/guidelines/software/accesssoftware.html  Thanks!

The default behavior of Tab key on Windows(IE) is to move between fields, while on Linux(Firefox), Tab key is used to type in ""tab"" into the text field 2. In EPFC, our original design is to use Tab key and Ctrl-Tab key to move between fields, Shift-Tab key is used to move in reverse order. No way to type in ""Tab"" into the text field. 3. We changed Ctrl-tab key's behavior. With the attached patch, Ctrl-Tab key is used for RTE to insert ""tab"" into text field. The solution is to intercept Ctrl-tab key pressing event and dynamically insert 4 ""space"" to the place where the cursor is.

Select Query Text type as Constant and enter the following text: select * from customers where customernumber <131 4. Drag the data set to layout and preview.  Actual result: Preview failed. I tried in 2.5.1 release build, it works. So it should be a regression.

There are many use-cases that are strictly serial workflows, and adding the dependency and overhead of EMF Transaction is unnecessary.  I propose splitting WorkflowContext into WorkflowContext and WorkflowTransactionalContext.  WorkflowContext would support serial workflows only and not depend on EMF Transaction.  WorkflowTransactionalContext would support both serial and parallel workflows, and depend on EMF Transaction.

These default strings are displayed when Text.isLoaded = false.  The code could be modified relatively easily to check the string's length, but the challenge is deciding the best behavior for the API when this is case.  Here is the logic for checking the string length.  For {module#1234}, len needs to be >= (9 + 5),  where 9 is the number of characters in ＾{module#}￣ and 5 is the maximum number of digits in a 16-bit module id.  For {module-rope:ABCD}, len needs to be >= (14 + 4), where ""{module-rope:}"" is 14 characters, and the 16-bit number is at most 4 hex digits.

This is caused because the listener's methods are invoke by the class given by the first listener instance instead of the given interface (the listener of the editor and listener of the Outline view are different classes but each of them implements the same interface).  Unfortunately, this means we need a parameter to specify the class/interface (the type of the actual generic parameter is unknown at runtime). I committed the fix.

2010-08-18 08:37:17 EDT,309151,Provide support for automatic tagging and map file updating,"Provide support for automatic tagging and map file updating [reply] Description Kenn Hussey 2010-04-14 11:40:39 EDT The ""old"" build system we used for EMF supported automatic tagging of source files in CVS and updated the associated map file accordingly. In order to switch over to the Buckminster build for EMF, we would need the same/similar support.  The idea here is that the revisions of the source that are used for a given build are tagged based on the build ID (timestamp) so that we can associate the contents of a build with specific source and load the corresponding revisions into a workspace using a map file. Of course, this should be an optional feature, in case folks still want to use the commit and release (tag) approach (in which case the build should be able to use a specific map file or equivalent cspec).

Such a support has only been implemented in the CVSReaderType provider. (Bug #323007 tracks a request to implement the support in other relevant providers.)  The tagging support is exposed in the form of a buckminster actor and is used from CSPEC/CSPEX files like this: <cs:public name=""tag"" actor=""buckminster.tag""> <cs:actorProperties> <cs:property key=""tag"" value=""build_${build.id}"" /> <cs:property key=""exclude.0"" value=""^org\.example\.library(?:\..+)?$"" /> <cs:property key=""exclude.1"" value=""^org\.example\.test(?:\..+)?$"" /> <cs:property key=""include.0"" value=""^org\.example\.library\.extensions(?:\..+)?$"" /> </cs:actorProperties> </cs:public>  where: ""buckminster.tag"" is the name of the buckminster actor implementing the tagging support ""tag"" is the property defining the tag to use when tagging the resources ""exclude.<n>"" are regular expression patterns denoting components to exclude from tagging ""include.<n>"" are regular expression patterns denoting components to include in the tagging operation regardless if they are matched by any number of ""exclude.<n>"" patterns  The tagging is performed on the current component (the component in which the CSPEC or CSPEX containing the above definition is found) and all its dependencies (even transitive) which happen to be present in the workspace.

[reply] Comment 1 Thomas Hallgren 2010-04-22 17:54:18 EDT Buckminster uses the team CVS provider which in turn uses extssh which in turn relies on the ssh configuration provided by the platform. This means that if you have configured a key pair (using standard ssh semantics) so that you can ssh to the CVS machine without getting prompted for a password, then Buckminster (and Eclipse IDE) will work too.  I might miss something here, but I don't think this is in Buckminsters domain.

Particularly the extssh method is not easily configurable in Buckminster, in fact the only options to configure it are: - to use workspace template - to use Buckminster's  exportprefs/importprefs commands neither of which is very flexible. It turns out to be more flexible to use the ext connection method as its default settings work just fine in server environment - it uses the external ssh command by default - and thus the needed configuration can be done at ssh level.  > This means that if > you have configured a key pair (using standard ssh semantics) so that you can > ssh to the CVS machine without getting prompted for a password, then > Buckminster (and Eclipse IDE) will work too. Yes, this works, but unfortunately this is not very suitable for the Hudson environment where different jobs need to use different credentials (private keys) to access the repositories they need, yet all of the jobs run under the same Hudson user account. It would be possible to add all of the required keys to the ssh configuration in Hudson's home directory but this is not straightforward since only Hudson user can read/write the respective files, moreover managing the private keys separately from the Hudson jobs that make use of them would inevitably lead to stale/obsolete private key files.  > > I might miss something here, but I don't think this is in Buckminsters domain. Given the reasons above (no flexible way to configure extssh method in Buckminster and the ext method not being suitable for extensive use in the Hudson environment), there is a valid need for Buckminster to provide a flexible way of configuring ssh parameters (which are used by the extssh method).  [reply] Comment 3 Michal Ruzicka 2010-05-26 21:26:38 EDT added two new preferences to Buckminster:  *sshPrivateKeys* a comma separated list of files each containing a private key to use when attempting SSH public key authentication (this preference corresponds to the ""Private Keys"" field found on the ""General"" tab of the ""General / Network Connections / SSH2"" preference page)  *ssh2Home* SSH implementation home directory - this directory is searched for the known_hosts file (this preference corresponds to the ""SSH2 Home"" field found on the ""General"" tab of the ""General / Network Connections / SSH2"" preference page)  committed in revision: 11445  Add Comment  Collapse All Comments Expand All Comments",michal.ruza@gmail.com
2010-04-26 02:29:56 EDT,310284,Need a way to publish a JRE IU into a p2 repository,"Need a way to publish a JRE IU into a p2 repository [reply] Description Michal Ruzicka 2010-04-23 09:57:02 EDT I have the following problem: I create a p2 repository as a primary result of my Buckminster based build, then I want to package certain components from this repository as the zip files used for distribution in the old days. Since the desired content of the zip files corresponds to dependencies of certain features that are part of the built repo, it is just natural to use the p2.director to install the required artifacts into an arbitrary location where they can be conveniently zipped.  But the p2.director refuses to install the required artifacts without their dependencies - this can be to large extent overcome by passing the target platform used during the build as one of the repository locations to be consulted by the p2.director. This naturally provides all the required dependencies (otherwise the build could not succeed) except one: JRE IU  Publishing a JRE IU into any of the repositories involved would solve the problem, that is why I need a way to do so.  [reply] Comment 1 Michal Ruzicka 2010-04-26 02:29:56 EDT Implemented as both: - actor: buckminster.JREPublisher - ant task: buckminster.publishJRE  Either of those needs to be told which p2 repository to publish the JRE to. This is done using metadata.repository actor property in case of the Actor, or using repository/metadataRepository attributes of the ant task.  It is also possible to specify which JRE Environment IU to publish, it is done using jre.environment.name actor property, repsectively jreEnvironment ant task attribute (if not specified a default JRE IU is published).

I will review the first part at Friday.  [reply] Comment 11 Igor Jacy Lino Campista 2010-05-06 00:37:45 EDT I have notice two files that perhaps were the byproduct of switching to the HEAD.  src/org/eclipse/wst/xml/vex/core/internal/validator/DFAState.java (-114 lines) src/org/eclipse/wst/xml/vex/core/internal/validator/DTDValidator.java (-330 lines)  Looks like they were removed since December and no are no more in the HEAD but they were by some reason registered in the patch in removed state.

The refactoring of AbstractAddRowHandler is definitely more complex than the most of the other changes in the patches. Igor, could you enter an own issue with a description of what should be done, to separate this refactoring from the other, more simple changes? There should also be a unit test to ensure that the logic is not changed.  Igor, you did a great job cleaning up the code base. I really like what you contributed so far.

Note, debugger backend should throw an > error for calls to > IMemoryBlockRetrievalExtension.getExtendedMemoryBlock(String, Object) > With CDT 7.0. I do receive an error pop-up when entering an invalid expression.  I investigated this problem further and found and this is what happened. We used our own expression service to evaluate the expression. It knew that the symbol was not defined but did not notify the request monitor that the request failed. Hence, the DataRequestMonitor in DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval.resolveMemoryAddress() handles handleSuccess(). ""String value = data.getFormattedValue().substring(2);"" actually contains an error message string. Therefore, ""drm.setData(new BigInteger(value, 16));"" threw an exception and the request was hung forever. We definitely should fix the bug in our expression service. As a safeguard, I think handleSuccess()should also catch exceptions.  [reply] Comment 3 Teodor Madan 2010-05-12 09:11:45 EDT I managed to reproduce this too.

2013-07-02 15:41:02 EDT,311912,Allow committers to rename jobs they can modify,"Allow committers to rename jobs they can modify [reply] Description Steve Powell 2010-05-06 11:26:14 EDT Presently although I can modify Hudson jobs (for which I have admin/modify permissions) I cannot rename them. I discover this part-way through the rename process on the Hudson GUI.  This is apparently because I am not granted create permission for a job, and rename is (probably) implemented as a create(clone) followed by a delete, each of which is checked for permissions.  Please implement rename as a separately controlled action with its own independent permissions control.  [reply] Comment 1 Nick Boldt 2010-05-11 10:10:15 EDT For which job do you need this control?

The initial set-up doesn't give me delete permission (and I understand why not) although I can grant myself delete.  but the message I got out when I tried to rename it was that I didn't have CREATE permission (which indeed I do not, and cannot obtain).  The job I was attempting to rename has been renamed by admin. I shouldn't need DELETE permission to rename; thus the enhancement request.  [reply] Comment 3 Eclipse Webmaster 2012-03-30 10:29:12 EDT Moving to the Hudson project.

It's that contents of phpdoc after an empty line are not included in tooltip. For example:  /** Line1 * * Line3 * * @author jacek * */ class Boo {  }  hovering over Boo (or tooltip in content-assist), will show only ""Line1"", but not ""Line3"".  This is not a big issue, however, typically PDT generates phpdoc blocks like: /** * * Enter description here ... * @author jacek * */  And because of empty line, the ""Enter description here..."" doesn't appear in tooltip.

Looking at org.eclipse.cdt.debug.internal.ui.disassembly.dsf.DisassemblyBackendCdi.setDebugContext(DisassemblyBackendCdi.java:132), it does a ""fTargetContext.getTopStackFrame()"". This function can return Null if the thread is not in suspended mode thus the stack frame is an empty list.  In our case the program is in the process of loading the share library so its thread is not suspended.  It's pretty re-producible with CDI. I haven't seen this problem with DSF.  Reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a program linking with a large shared library 2. Debug this program with CDI remote debug 3. Make sure the disassembly view is opened before you run the debug.  [reply] Comment 1 John Cortell 2010-06-17 17:20:42 EDT Created attachment 172162 [details] Fix  Andy, please try this patch with your reproducible scenario. It occurred to me that the code can't really rely on the thread being suspended. All we know is that at some point in time, we had a suspended thread and one of its frames was set as the active debug context. The thread may have since been resumed, died, whatever. We can use whatever static information we can get from the frame context, but we can't assume anything else. We simply have to be more guarded in that logic.

When switching debug context, the edit box shows last entered value. It would be good if it were possible to keep that value in synch with rendering.  Steps To Reproduce: 1. Start a debug session for configuration with more than one cpu. 2. Open memory view with debug context set to CPU A and enter an address in Memory Browser. 3. Change debug context to CPU B and enter a new address in Memory Browser. 4. Switching between CPU A and CPU B changes the rendering correctly and tab title is also showing correct address, but edit box where address was originally entered does not change.  It would be good if address edit box could be kept in synch as well. Since this is where I entered my address, I tend to look there for address information.

I'm using GMF SDK 2.3.0.v20100508 and Windows 7, but haven't tried on Vista.  To configure to use TreeRouter, you need only to modify  org.eclipse.gmf.examples.mindmap.rcp.diagram.preferences.DiagramPreferenceInitializer.java  as described in step 2.  The error message will appear on the console of the eclipse workbench, from which the mindmap application is started.  Regards, Yu  [reply] Comment 3 Johannes Michler 2011-04-21 09:44:45 EDT I can reproduce this with windows 7 and the Helios 3.6.2 GMF-Builds ().  Please note: The error doesn't occur on every creation of a connection but is somewhat random. But when trying to create 10 connections, be assured at least once there will be the mentioned null-pointer-exception.  I tried to track this down by adding a breakpoint to the first line of the method  org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.draw2d.ui.internal.routers.TreeRouter.getTargetAnchorRelativeBounds(Connection)  with the following condition: conn.getTargetAnchor().getOwner()==null  (This is where Yu Li has his NPE in line 130 of the TreeRouter.java).  I think the problem is caused in TreeRouter.invalidate-Method:  public void invalidate(Connection conn) { if (conn.getSourceAnchor() == null || conn.getSourceAnchor().getOwner() == null || conn.getTargetAnchor() == null || conn.getTargetAnchor().getOwner() == null) return;  ListIterator li = connectionList.listIterator(); while (li.hasNext()) { Connection connNext = (Connection)li.next();  if (!trunkVertexEqual(connNext, conn)) { updateConstraint(connNext); } } }   There is a check if conn.getTargetAnchor().getOwner() is null. But this is done on the conn-Object, whereas some lines further-down updateConstraint is called with some Connection from the connectionList.  When having the mentioned NPE, the situation while being in the invalidate-Method is as follows:  conn.getSourceAnchor() and conn.getTargetAnchor() are both the same SlideableAnchor pointing to a DefaultSizeNodeFigure. Therefore in the first line of invalidate everything is fine  The connectionList consists of one single PolyLineConnection. This connNext-Object has the same SlideableAnchor as its source as the conn-Object. But the target of the connNext-Object points to an XYAnchor. And calling the getOwner() method of an XYAnchor returns null. This is what leads to the NPE later on in the getTargetAnchorRelativeBounds-Method.   My proposed fix for this is to check the owner of the sourceAnchor and targetAnchor before calling udpateConstraint on connNext. I've attached a patch that fixes the problem on the mindmap-sample.  Yu Li: Could you please verify?  I'd propse to bring this into 3.7, since the bug is really annoying when using the tree-router...

Especially all the toolbar entries should also appear in main menu.  [reply] Comment 1 Michael Wenz 2011-02-07 11:14:59 EST Thinks to check: 1. Put only the most commonly used commands on the view toolbar. Any command on a toolbar must also appear in a menu, either the window menu, context menu or the view menu. http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Guidelines#Toolbars_2 2. If a view or editor has support for Cut, Copy, Paste, or any of the global commands, these commands must be executable from the same commands in the window menu bar and toolbar. http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Guidelines#Menus and http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Guidelines#Integration_with_the_Window_Menu_Bar_and_Toolbar  [reply] Comment 2 Juergen Pasch 2011-04-01 12:33:51 EDT The above text and links are related to views and not to editors in the UI guidelines.  Therefore, these issues are clarified here again.  A VIEW consists of a title area, a (view specific) toolbar, a (view specific) pulldown menu, and an embedded control, which comprises a context menu. The context menu is used for selection oriented commands ( 7.13), while the pulldown menu shall offer presentation commands (7.10). The (view specific) toolbar is used to expose the most commonly used commands in a view (7.12). Any command on this view toolbar must also appear either in the context menu or the pull down menu. Examples for 7.12 are hard to find, because integration with the Window Menu Bar and Toolbar is similiar: if a view has support for Cut, Copy, Paste, or any of the global commands, these commands must be executable from the same commands in the window menu bar and toolbar (7.19).  The guidelines for EDITORS are simpler, they do not have specific toolbars and pull down menus and no presentation commands.  1. All of the commands, except for the obvious commands, available in the editor should be added to the window menu bar (6.7).  2. If an editor has support for Cut, Copy, Paste, or any of the global commands, these commands must be executable from the same commands in the window menu bar and toolbar (6.9).  3. An editor may contribute commands directly to the window toolbar. The toolbar is used to expose the most commonly used commands in an editor. Any command which appears in the toolbar must also appear in the menu, but there is no need to duplicate every command in the menu within the toolbar (6.10).  4. Fill the context menu with selection oriented commands (6.11). All commands for the view (or editor) should be made available on the main menubar, and only frequently used commands are on the context menu.  CHECK if Graphiti follows the rules 1 - 4. When checking 1, take notice of guideline 6.8.  For 1-4 consider the selection state of the command (6.13).  For 4 take account of 6.12 - 6.15  [reply] Comment 3 Juergen Pasch 2011-04-13 07:43:28 EDT Wrong behaviour of selection states in actions are corrected.  The main menu bar is extended with: File-> Export Diagram..; Edit-> Remove, Update, Align-> <all alignment commands>.  Short cuts needed adjustments and accelerators for Export Diagram, Remove and Update are implemented.

ADDITIONAL INFO The branding works like this: 1) a feature containing templates of launchers for all supported ws, os, arch combinations (e.g. org.eclipse.equinox.executable) is located  2) a temporary copy of the template for the ws, os, arch combination which is currently being built is created; the contents of the temporary template copy is reflected in an instance of org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor class see: org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.eclipse.EquinoxExecutableAction.brandExecutables()  3) the branding process is invoked on the temporary template copy; this branding process applies all the branding to the files in the temporary template copy, correctly creating all the files appropriate for the current platform (including the icons); but the branding process does not have the corresponding instance of the org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor class at hand to reflect the changes it makes there see: org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.tasks.EquinoxExecutableAction.fullBrandExecutables() org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.tasks.BrandingIron  4) after the branding process finishes no real attempt is made to detect the changes it made and so most of them are *NOT* reflected (though some of the changes are expected and thus reflected) in the corresponding instance of the org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor class see: org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.tasks.EquinoxExecutableAction.fullBrandExecutables()  5) ultimately the instance of the org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor class is used to create the resulting binary IU  From what's summarized above it follows that despite the branding process does its job right the changes it makes are not reflected in the resulting IU as the corresponding instance of org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor class is not updated accordingly.  Comment 1 Michal Ruzicka 2010-09-14 19:49:15 EDT Created attachment 178891 [details] org.eclipse.buckminster.pde-branding_refactoring.patch  The attached patch gives the branding code in org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.tasks.BrandingIron access to the instance of org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor describing the launcher template to be branded. The patch further makes sure that any changes made to the template are immediately reflected in the corresponding org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor descriptor.  Comment 2 Thomas Hallgren 2010-09-15 01:27:19 EDT ASAICS, this patch will fail if executed on a windows machine. In particular, there's an if that conditionally links stuff if the os is not Windows but there's no else with a fallback solution in case it is.  There's some calls to *nix specific chmod on executables. Isn't that something that p2 is supposed to do during install using touchpoints?  Comment 3 Michal Ruzicka 2010-09-15 19:30:46 EDT (In reply to comment #2) > ASAICS, this patch will fail if executed on a windows machine. In particular, > there's an if that conditionally links stuff if the os is not Windows but > there's no else with a fallback solution in case it is. > There is no ""else"" clause, but still the code falls back to do a copy of the resource if the link command fails; further the copy is done on Windows* systems right away (without first trying the link command). To be able to perform the copy operation in both of these situations with a single code block I could not wrap it in the ""else"" clause of the ""if"" statement checking the result of the link command. Instead I've created a named block which is simply exited if the link command succeeds. But in case the link command fails (or if it is not even attempted when on Windows) the execution of the named block continues and reaches the code performing the copy.  > There's some calls to *nix specific chmod on executables. Isn't that something > that p2 is supposed to do during install using touchpoints? > You are right, calling chmod is most probably useless in the branding code. Given the fact that whatever the branding code creates is eventually packed into a jar file, anything the chmod call might have set is lost. Attaching a new version of the patch without the chmod calls.

Comment 7 Michal Ruzicka 2010-09-30 08:08:18 EDT Created attachment 179944 [details] org.eclipse.buckminster.pde-branding_refactoring_v3.patch  Improved version of the patch which (in addition to changes introduced by the previous version of the patch) removes the ""root"" attribute from the org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.tasks.BrandingIron class. The attribute is not necessary as the org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.publisher.eclipse.ExecutablesDescriptor which is passed down to all the methods as a parameter contains the same information.  Comment 8 Michal Ruzicka 2010-09-30 08:25:16 EDT I tested the changes captured in org.eclipse.buckminster.pde-branding_refactoring_v3.patch on: - Windows XP - Mac OS X 10.5 - openSUSE Linux 11.3 (x86_64) Both with and without the org.eclipse.equinox.executable feature present in the target platform. Everything worked as expected so I've committed the patch in revision 11582 to the helios-maintenance branch.  Comment 9 Michal Ruzicka 2010-09-30 08:32:03 EDT Is there a Hudson job for building Buckminster on the new hardware (hudson.eclipse.org) yet?

Discarding the latter"", ini.getAbsolutePath(), ini2.getAbsolutePath()); //$NON-NLS-1$ ini2.delete(); // This should not happen really } } else if (ini2.exists()) { ini = ini2; } else return;  ...  StringBuffer buffer; try { buffer = readFile(ini); } catch (IOException e) { logger.error(e, ""Impossible to brand ini file""); //$NON-NLS-1$ return; }  When the MacOS/eclipse.ini file happens to exist in a case insensitive filesystem then both the warning and the error message from the above code excerpt are printed. The reason is that ini and ini2 files are in fact identical on a case insensitive filesystem, so if ini exists then ini2 must exists too (as it is the same file). The code above misinterprets this and reacts with deletion of the ini2 file (and thus whit deletion of ini). Which is later manifested by the error message when an attempt is made to read the deleted ini file.

It turns the build is not quite correct. The likely cause is that it was created using Buckminster containing Bug #302804.  Details & Workaround: The mentioned bug causes the source feature to have exactly the same presentation name (label) as the binary feature. Indeed if you browse the Helios release repository (http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios) with the ""Install New Software"" wizard you'll notice there are actually two ""EMF Common"" features (with the exact same versions!): EMF Common	2.6.0.v20100914-1218 EMF Common	2.6.0.v20100914-1218 The workaround follows: Find out (by inspecting details of the features via the ""More..."" link in the ""Details"" section of the wizard's dialog window) which of the two is the source one and install it.  Since a workaround is provided for the current build and any future EMF builds will use a fixed version of Buckminster (which should ensure the issue will not recur) resolving this issue as fixed.

2012-01-31 20:37:38 EST,335495,"HeapStd should support unlimited ""heap size""","HeapStd should support unlimited ""heap size"" [reply] Description Sasha Slijepcevic 2011-01-26 13:56:33 EST +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #292207 +++ 292207 was fixed in 3.20 series by adding a comment. In 3.21, we may want to remove programatically any limits for targets with unlimited heap.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On High-Level OS's (HLOS) like Linux and WinCE, malloc() has [essentially] no limit.  (I know, I know... there's always a limit, but it's ""really big"").  XDC users that integrate HeapStd-based heap managers into their HLOS system can easily trip up and ""run out of memory"" by allocating more than the configured heap size (typically the value of Memory.defaultHeapSize - which is defaulted to a meager 4kB!).  This 'heap size' is an artificial limit imposed by HeapStd on systems with virtual memory.  It forces system integrators to define some arbitrarily ""big enough"" amount of memory.  System integrators can never get this right - all they can do is configure it 'too small' - which, when hit, throws an Error and halts the system.  Not sure how to solve this... perhaps we should make HeapStd respect a '-1' heap size that means 'disable your size checking'?  This might render getStats() invalid - but maybe that's okay if eases this use case.  Comment 1 dave russo 2009-10-21 17:05:33 EDT The original motivation for requiring a size was to enable reasonably close approximation of application behavior which is being run in a ""host emulation"" environment.  Karl strongly advocated this use case and we should continue to support it.  On the other hand, I completely agree that HeapStd should support an ""unlimited mode"" to make it possible to leverage all underlying system resources.  Comment 2 dave russo 2011-01-10 20:14:04 EST Fix docs to mention how the heap size can be set to a arbitrarily large value - 0xFFFFFFFF - to address this particular usecase. In a later release (XDCtools 3.21?) address this problem by either (a) Making a new heap module with a large default heap size (b) Changing the default heap size of HeapStd  [reply] Comment 1 Vikram Adiga 2012-01-31 20:37:38 EST A special parameter HEAP_MAX has been added into the HeapStd module. Using this parameter when creating HeapStd instance will disable the size checking and allow unlimited memory mode (works as long as malloc() keeps allocating memory)  Also, if the Memory.defaultHeapInstance is not initialized, a HeapStd instance of size HEAP_MAX will be assigned to it by default.  Fix will be in released in the next xdc tree release (xdc-z05).  [reply] Comment 2 Sasha Slijepcevic 2013-02-22 14:27:26 EST Verified against 3.25.00.40 using the native Linux targets and C64P ELF. I did not create a default heap in the config script, and I verified that in that case a HeapStd heap is created with the size of ~0U. Then, using Memory_getStats function, I verified that the size of the heap is ~0U at runtime.

[reply] Comment 1 Alexandra Schladebeck 2011-05-16 08:12:33 EDT Using our text style files, I adapted the place where it appeared that the current GUIdancer banner was being pulled from, and nothing happened.  The banner that I thought was being used doesn't seem to be - it has e.g. an old version number on it, and the documentation shows the correct one.  We need to find out where the banner is being taken from and how to incorporate the Jubula banner when we build the Jubula documentation.

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Complete the graphiti tutorial up to adding the custom feature to rename a class. 2. Create a new EClass with name ""A"". 3. Rename the class to ""AA"". 4. Now try and resize it, this will fail but moving it will succeed.  [reply] Comment 1 Juergen Pasch 2011-04-28 10:09:59 EDT Resizing the EClass after the described steps in the early stage of the tutorial is not possible, because the edit policy GFNonResizableEditPolicy is instantiated in this particular situation: at this time ""canResize"" delivered ""false"". GFNonResizableEditPolicy erroneously does *never* consider the resize feature itself. As opposed to this GFResizableEditPolicy inspects ""canResize"" and works fine. Maybe most shapes are created ""resizable"", before they become ""un-resizable"", so that might be the reason the wrong behaviour was never reported before. Now the edit policy GFResizableEditPolicy works alone, since it can handle ""canResize"" changes.

Instead, it displays ? on the entire cell that contain an unreadable byte, hiding bytes that, in fact, were correcly read.  Example: Read 4 bytes, the 1st byte was unreadable, the rest were read and have all value 0. Display is hex, big endian, 4 bytes per cell. Currently displayed: ???????? Must display: ??000000  The fix should enable pe byte display on unreadable bytes for hex and binary radices. These are the only radices which have 1 to N mapping between the read bytes array and chars in the formatted array (1 to 2 for hex, 1 to 8 for binary).   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. While debugging, open a traditional memory rendering over a memory area that has isolated unreadable bytes. 2. Choose hex or binary radix. 3. Observe that not only the unreadable bytes are marked with ? but the entire cells to which they belong.

While doing so, StandardExecutableImporter will replicate absolute path to binary as subfolders in ""Executable"" project. The folder structure is replicated to act as a namespace to ensure uniqueness of the binary file.  Instead of using a path from physical local folders, standard executable importer should instead create a chain of virtual folders and mark them as derived. - Creating virtual folders is a lot more lighter operation. - Marking as derived will ensure that a good chunk of resource listeners will disregard the event for derived resources.

This can be reproduces in the GMF Logic example. The Save All Action remains active.   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new GMF Logic example 2. create a LED (the editor gets dirty) 3. select the LED 4. The save action / CTRL + S is disabled / does not work!  Comment 1 Jan Koehnlein 2011-05-24 19:01:50 EDT This seems to be a problem for *ALL* GMF-based editors, including the Xtext GMF integration example of Xtext.  I had to remove that example from the Xtext Indigo release because of bugs like this (and the lack of responsiveness to bug reports from GMF Tooling).  Comment 2 Andreas Muelder 2011-05-25 11:48:51 EDT The DiagramActionBarContributor causes the problem.  ContributionItemService.getInstance()				.contributeToActionBars(bars, descriptor);  registers global action handlers for the save action (GlobalSaveAction) and I think the enable state is not updated when the editor fires the dirty state change.  Maybe this has something to do with the replacement of the SaveAction with org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.SaveHandler in 3.7 ?  As a workaround, you can override the init method in your XXActionBarContributor:  @Override public void init(IActionBars bars) { super.init(bars); //use the default global action handlers. bars.clearGlobalActionHandlers(); }  This works for me...  Comment 3 Andreas Muelder 2011-05-25 11:56:46 EDT The previous workaround breaks undo / redo. This is the right one:  @Override public void init(IActionBars bars) { super.init(bars); //use the default global action handlers. bars.setGlobalActionHandler(GlobalActionId.SAVE, null); }  Comment 4 Jan Koehnlein 2011-05-29 05:56:26 EDT It is too late to reenable our Xtext example for Indigo. Seems not only GMF Tooling is abandoned.  Comment 5 Aurelien Pupier 2011-05-30 03:19:05 EDT I don't have time to investigate why it is happenning.  If you have a patch to propose, you're welcome :)  Comment 6 Alexander Ny?en 2011-05-30 04:01:38 EDT SaveHandler has been introduced to the workbench UI in terms of bug #270007, so the comments there may be worth investigating.  RC4 is going to be finalized this Friday so I think we really have to gain ground on this one quite soon. Shipping an Indigo release where no GMF-based graphical editor is able to perfom a save would be quite a nasty thing...  Comment 7 Mathieu Velten 2011-05-30 04:13:14 EDT In papyrus we workaround the bug by registering PapyrusGlobalActionHandlerProvider and DiagramWithPrintGlobalActionHandlerProvider on IGraphicalEditPart for save and print action.

Save action is enable/disable at the wrong time. This is related to GMF and has nothing to do with Papyrus.  Comment 11 Aurelien Pupier 2011-05-30 05:00:18 EDT ok I understood that it was not related to Papyrus. I was just asking in order to be sure that they observed the issue with Eclipse 3.7 only and if they already find good fix/workaround.  Thanks to confirm that it is on Eclipse 3.7 and point your workaround  Comment 12 Anthony Hunter 2011-05-31 10:14:05 EDT This issue does not involve Papyrus, I can duplicate without Papyrus in my target.  I have all the M4 dependencies required for the GMF Logic Example and the problem does not occur in this M4 based target.  I installed GMF RC1 into this M4 based target and the problem still does not occur.  The problem is definitely there in the latest RC3 downloads.  It would seem there is a regression outside of the GMF Runtime. Do we think the regression was caused by bug 270007 ?  Comment 13 Anthony Hunter 2011-05-31 10:18:15 EDT It is strange that the GEF Logic example does not have the same issue in RC3.  Comment 14 Mariot Chauvin 2011-05-31 10:43:41 EDT (In reply to comment #13) > It is strange that the GEF Logic example does not have the same issue in RC3.  This is definitively linked to bug 270007. I try to debug since yesterday to find how to fix this, but this is really not easy.  Here is what I understand so far : With the 270007 commit save action is now replaced with a SaveHandler (same for save all action). However when we registered the GlobalSaveAction handler in ContributionItemService#contributeToActionBars, the DirtyStateUpdater (from platform UI) will fire an event to an HandlerProxy instance which will not have as listener the command with ""org.eclipse.ui.file.save"" as id.  I am not sure if this is a platform bug or weird use on our side.  Comment 15 Mickael Istria 2011-05-31 11:05:11 EDT I think it is a bug in GMF since only GMF-based editors have this behavior. I don't think platform is to blame.  After having a look at it together with Aurelien, we noticed that the GlobalAction#refresh method is not able to find a handler for the ""org.eclipse.ui.file.save"" command when a node is selected, whereas it can find one handler when nothing is selected or when a field in properties view is selected. My guess is that this method should always find a GlobalSaveAction whenever a GMF editor is active.

If I add IGraphicalEditpart as ElementType (previously only DiagramEditPart) fro the save globalActionID: <ElementType class=""org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.ui.editparts.IGraphicalEditPart""> <GlobalActionId actionId=""save""> </GlobalActionId> </ElementType>  it seems that the enablement state of the save chnage always one time after it should have. What I mean is: - editor not dirty -> save not enable -  move an element -> save not enable but saveALl enable - click onb another element -> save enable - do what you want staying on the editor except save -> save enablement stays - do a save -> saveAll is not enabled, save is still enabled - click on a figure -> save is no more enable  Comment 23 Aurelien Pupier 2011-06-01 05:37:18 EDT Created attachment 197074 [details] fix the issue  I add IGraphicalEditPart for ElementTypes of GlobalActionID save AND in GlobalSaveAction, put it to react to property change (IPropertyListener) so in our case react when a figure is moved or modified.

I tried your patch. It only works with an additional extension point registration (org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.common.ui.services.action.globalActionHandlerProviders)  So the default behaviour (if no globalAction handler is registered explicitly) is still broken and editors without that registration won't work.

Oh god you're right. I made my patch badly and it required that the global action handler is registered explicitly.  So what is needed in order that the SaveHandler of Eclipse is called when there is a modification on the diagram?

I personally prefer to build graphical editors ""by hand"" with GMF Runtime.

But if you are build ding by hand you have to the globalActionId for DiagramEditPart, isn't it?  For previous editor that are not using GMF Tooling, perhaps just a migration note can be enough if we don't find a real solution?  Comment 32 Mathieu Velten 2011-06-01 08:32:13 EDT I don't know if it used to work out of the box before but the printing action is also not available by default. registering DiagramWithPrintGlobalActionHandlerProvider fix the problem, and with your patch the save works great too.  So if at least the patch is committed it will be ok for papyrus.

But what about others action:  cut, copy, paste, bookmark, delete  do we have the same issue with other Providers and if not why we don't have them?

When building by hand, I never had to register any globalActionHandlerProviders by hand. The default behaviour for save worked as expected out of the box.  Comment 35 Mathieu Velten 2011-06-01 09:01:19 EDT (In reply to comment #33) > for DiagramWithprint perhaps I can apply the same fix as GlobalSaveAction.  It seems ok, an equivalent code to handle property changes seems to be present in GlobalPrintAction. what I was saying is, as with save, print is not available out of the box if you're not registering anything on globalActionHandlerProviders.

I think that we don't have the same definition of out of the box.  Comment 37 Mathieu Velten 2011-06-01 09:27:01 EDT for me out of the box means without registering something on globalActionHandlerProviders extension point. in this case save and print are not available at all while it used to be with helios.  I am ignoring your patch here since I think it should be committed anyway.

As I said previously, when I debug I found that the HandlerProxy does not has a listener the save command instance.  >What are your DiagramActionBarContributor and >ContributionItemService.getInstance() >.contributeToActionBars(bars, descriptor); > doing?  Just getting the part IActionBars and calling >setGlobalActionHandler(*)?  yes you may find the code in AbstractContributionItemProvider class, but it is really difficult to follow without debugging.  >I think yes as the SaveAllHandler is working  Yes the SaveAllHandler is working fine but we GMF does not override the default global action handler for save all command.  Comment 43 Anthony Hunter 2011-06-06 10:28:11 EDT Summarize, a change in the platform in 3.7 M4 has caused a regression such that save is never enabled on a dirty editor with a selection on the diagram.  If we do nothing, save will be broken on all GMF Runtime based editors when we release Indigo.  If we install the patch, we are partially confident the problem is solved.  The change is limited to the save action, so the solution cannot do further damage than save not working at all. Given the risk, I way we commit the patch for RC4.

The class header says it is an ""internal collection ..."", but currently, users cannot access those units in their projects.  If it is agreed that NonSI is too vague, some units should be moved to a UK specific set, and others to an SI-affine set, in which I would put units which are non-SI but whose definition is dependent on SI (e.g., kilogram-force, metric ton, angstrom).  Reproducible: Always  Comment 1 Werner Keil 2013-03-19 07:32:32 EDT The use of NonSI is disregarded. Like all other unit systems it was moved to org.eclipse.uomo.units.impl.system. Actually it should probably go to org.eclipse.uomo.units.internal or subpackages, which is a reserved package name for these kinds of internal types. OSGi usually prevents them from being used. Will explore that, otherwise it is package local in ""system"" and CommonUnits should instead be used to access these kinds of units.  Unlike other systems, CommonUnits is not final, and it could theoretically be extended by something like MyCommonUnits. For most other cases however, defining custom unit systems should be done by extending org.eclipse.uomo.units.AbstractSystemOfUnits.

Now grab the label and drag it around. 5. You will see the above ClassCastException.  This issue can be fixed by adding the following to XYLayoutEditPolicy:  @Override protected Rectangle getCurrentConstraintFor(GraphicalEditPart child) { IFigure figure = child.getFigure(); Object constraint = figure.getParent().getLayoutManager().getConstraint(figure); return constraint instanceof Rectangle ?

2013-03-07 05:53:14 EST,349659,Central Input Validation derived from config,"Central Input Validation derived from config [reply] Description Ivan Motsch 2011-06-17 04:58:44 EDT Scout has two sides: client modeling and server service modeling. Building client models involves configuring properties such as mandatory (required), maxLength, min,max, codeType etc.  SDK creates and manages the form data for a form. The form data is the ""data"" copy of the form (bean).  It would be of great benefit if the sdk would also copy in some form the validation rule attributes to the form data, so the server side could (scout-based) perform central iniput validation based on these rules.  [reply] Comment 1 Ivan Motsch 2011-06-17 05:13:02 EDT Base concept is designed and implemented: There is a new annotation ""ValidationRule"" that is added to all getConfigured methods on form fields that influence validation. Can also be custom ones.  For example the AbstractStringField has such an annotation at @ValidationRule(ValidationRule.MAX_LENGTH) getConfiguredMaxLength  The sdk will detect this and add code to the form field data (shared area).  The serve side may override the ServiceTunnelServlet.filterInbound method and perform all the default checks with 3 lines of code (central input validation):  if(obj instanceof AbstractFormData){ new DefaultFormDataValidator((AbstractFormData)obj).validate(); }  So far the runtime framework part is done, the sdk part is in development.  [reply] Comment 2 Judith Gull 2013-03-05 04:48:27 EST I updated the javadoc in ServiceTunnelServlet to match the current implementation.  What is missing for Scout SDK? Some code is already generated for input validation in the formdata. Please close this ticket and create a ticket for Scout SDK with the desired features.

Comment 3 Werner Keil 2013-04-28 09:30:02 EDT Given UOMo is now generally built using Tycho/Maven, this issue may only arise, if manual PDE export used a wrong encoding, i.E.

Comment 3 Juergen Schumacher 2011-07-18 11:14:12 EDT No, I did not yet find a matching issue. But then, the search on bugs.sun.com sucks (-;  Comment 4 thomas menzel 2011-07-28 10:52:10 EDT i found another thing out today: if i take out the optional directive <?xml version=""1.1"" encoding=""utf-8""?> then it works -- or at least i cannot reproduce the bug.  it is also sufficient to set it to version 1.0....  i posted a bug for this @ bugs.sun.com and got the request ID 2087434  since we have a workaround know i set this to resolved  Comment 5 thomas menzel 2011-09-21 05:23:48 EDT @JS since setting the version solves it, shouldnt we set the version 1.0 also when we serialize  the record?  and if yes: for brevity even completely drop the declaration, which then defaults silently to v1.0 and utf-8 anyhow?  Comment 6 Juergen Schumacher 2011-09-21 05:35:01 EDT Fine with me. However, I don't remember why it was set to 1.1 initially. It may have been to workaround of another problem.  Comment 7 thomas menzel 2011-09-21 05:37:39 EDT i had looked up the diff between 1.1 and 1.0 already a while back, and it had smth. todo with line endings for some special encodings if i remember correctly.  anyhow, since u are not sure on this i will post in in the dev list to get a broader view.  Comment 8 thomas menzel 2011-09-23 05:54:46 EDT i have changed the version to 1.0.  i did some digging thru the SVN version and i showed that JS had set this in rev 577 where he gave the class a complete overhaul. since he doesnt remember a good reason to have 1.1 i figured it is save to go back to 1.0.

Requested by AiE (SH) and others in the community (see related Bugzillas)  [reply] Comment 2 Michael Wenz 2011-07-20 04:18:51 EDT An alternative implementation I could imagine would be not to set any default values at metamodel level (leaving null there) and defining the default in the framework.

[reply] Comment 3 Michael Keppler 2011-07-21 03:50:48 EDT Your last suggestion sounds most reasonable for me.

We would not reset the default values from the metamodel, because diagrams from existing tools would have another appearance.  We decided not to implement a default style, because we found no solution how to persist it without having the necessity to build a migration tool for existing diagrams, and we found a better, more coherent solution.  Besides the old create-methods there are now corresponding createPlain-methods, which are creating ""naked"" graphics algorithms without style attributes, and a createPlainStyle method without default values.  Using these new methods, makes it more transparent when working with styles, and very explicit in coding, which style attributes are set.  The chapter about styles in the tutorial will be adjusted accordingly. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=357922.

Not doing this can result in strange errors (timeouts, odd behaviour, not being able to map etc) and whenever this happens time is lost looking for the cause of the problem. It would be great if the version of the RCP plugin in the AUT could be checked to see if it is the correct one, and a warning shown if it is not. This would save a lot of time and confusion when migrating.  [reply] Comment 1 Tom Brus 2011-08-18 09:47:41 EDT I would suggest to generate an error message instead of a warning if the versions of the RCP plugin are incompatible. It would be no use continuing the test.  [reply] Comment 2 Alexandra Schladebeck 2011-10-07 08:21:50 EDT An initial implementation for this has now been done. If the RC Plugin is not the correct version, the AUT is ended and a message is written into the log. This isn't as well-rounded as it could be, but it does mean that we now have a defined behaviour as well as a place to read what the problem was. This is in the currently released version (1.1), but will only be useful from the next version, when the RC RCP Plugin changes again.

2011-11-03 05:57:15 EDT,356426,Use public column index constant in AbstractTableFieldData,"Use public column index constant in AbstractTableFieldData [reply] Description Jeremie Bresson 2011-08-31 23:40:17 EDT I would like to have constant for column index in AbstractTableFieldData.  I already have some Table Utility (server side) that rely on this index given as int. The index is used in getValueAt or setValueAt... This is usefull when you use a table formdata object extending AbstractTableFieldData in an other way than with a select into, or if you want to check something (eg a uniqueness constraint in java) and reuse the code between different column/table.  Having just an integer (even if it is declared a constant in my code) is dangerous, because if I remove a column in the client, my code wont be broken in the server (as it can be with a FormData-statement-builder if I remove a field).   Here is how the generated code looks like now: public class Questions extends AbstractTableFieldData { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;  public Questions() { }  public void setQuestionNr(int row, Integer questionNr) { setValueInternal(row, 0, questionNr); }  public Integer getQuestionNr(int row) { return (Integer) getValueInternal(row, 0); }  public void setQuestionText(int row, String questionText) { setValueInternal(row, 1, questionText); }  public String getQuestionText(int row) { return (String) getValueInternal(row, 1); }  @Override public int getColumnCount() { return 2; }  @Override public Object getValueAt(int row, int column) { switch (column) { case 0: return getQuestionNr(row); case 1: return getQuestionText(row); default: return null; } }  @Override public void setValueAt(int row, int column, Object value) { switch (column) { case 0: setQuestionNr(row, (Integer) value); break; case 1: setQuestionText(row, (String) value); break; } } }   Here is what I am expecting from the SDK: public class Questions extends AbstractTableFieldData { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public static final int QUESTION_NR_COLUMN_INDEX = 0; public static final int QUESTION_TEXT_COLUMN_INDEX = 1;  public Questions() { }  public void setQuestionNr(int row, Integer questionNr) { setValueInternal(row, QUESTION_NR_COLUMN_INDEX, questionNr); }  public Integer getQuestionNr(int row) { return (Integer) getValueInternal(row, QUESTION_NR_COLUMN_INDEX); }  public void setQuestionText(int row, String questionText) { setValueInternal(row, QUESTION_TEXT_COLUMN_INDEX, questionText); }  public String getQuestionText(int row) { return (String) getValueInternal(row, QUESTION_TEXT_COLUMN_INDEX); }  @Override public int getColumnCount() { return 2; }  @Override public Object getValueAt(int row, int column) { switch (column) { case QUESTION_NR_COLUMN_INDEX: return getQuestionNr(row); case QUESTION_TEXT_COLUMN_INDEX: return getQuestionText(row); default: return null; } }  @Override public void setValueAt(int row, int column, Object value) { switch (column) { case QUESTION_NR_COLUMN_INDEX: setQuestionNr(row, (Integer) value); break; case QUESTION_TEXT_COLUMN_INDEX: setQuestionText(row, (String) value); break; } } }  [reply] Comment 1 Jeremie Bresson 2011-09-29 17:00:11 EDT Created attachment 204327 [details] patch for this bug  Add a patch that does the proposed feature.

2011-09-10 11:24:40 EDT,356737,UnitFormatTest fails due to locale-specific unit symbol comparison,"UnitFormatTest fails due to locale-specific unit symbol comparison [reply] Description Peter Melnikov 2011-09-05 11:34:43 EDT Build Identifier: built using maven 2, java version ""1.6.0_26""  UnitFormatTest.toStringTest() fails because it tries to compare units symbols that are locale specific. In the test's source code it is 'm' for metre compared to a symbol from message resources. On machine with different locale settings (e.g. russian with cyrillic) it will be different and they will not match.   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup russian locale 2. Run maven package  [reply] Comment 1 Peter Melnikov 2011-09-05 11:35:56 EDT Created attachment 202765 [details] UnitFormatTest surefire report  [reply] Comment 2 Werner Keil 2011-09-06 07:25:29 EDT Peter,  Thanks a lot for sharing that. I placed a link to the original issue in the heritage from JSR-275 here, too.  This test is among those influenced by the Unit JSR proposal. It should work equally well using the COMPARISON_LOCALE, I'll fix it as soon as I can. Should you have a patch, please feel free to attach it here (it isn't too obvious, but this URL explains relatively well how to create at patch with Git: http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)  P.s.: The JSR also contained many translations, some of which are supposed to go into Eclipse Babel. The initial import may have lost them, but I'm hoping to add them for other languages than German, too. If you're interested and able, please use your Bugzilla ID to join Babel: http://babel.eclipse.org/ adding further Russian translations to UOMo and other projects.  Thanks, Werner  [reply] Comment 3 Werner Keil 2011-09-10 11:24:40 EDT Changed the method from toString() test to also use a UnitFormat. Since the test as such compares multiple operations, toString() isn't the only way to retrieve and compare those. Tests pass as before, should work regardless of the default locale.
